## Overview

The fake field goal is a deceptive special teams play in which the field goal unit lines up as if to attempt a kick but instead executes a run or pass play designed to gain a first down or score a touchdown. The play exploits the defense's expectation that a kick is coming, catching block rushers and coverage players out of position. Because the defense typically sends a heavy rush to block the kick and assigns few players to cover receivers, the fake field goal can create wide-open opportunities when executed with precision. However, a failed attempt surrenders possession, often in scoring territory, making it one of football's highest-stakes gambles.

## Types of Fake Field Goals

### Holder Pass

The most common fake field goal involves the holder receiving the snap, rising from the kneeling position, and throwing a pass to an eligible receiver. The holder — typically a punter or backup quarterback — must sell the fake by initially presenting as though the hold is normal before standing and delivering the throw. The intended receiver is usually a wing player, a tight end, or a lineman who has reported as eligible. These receivers release from their blocking position and run a short route into open space vacated by the block rush. The holder pass is effective because the defense is focused on the interior rush and rarely accounts for receivers in the flat or at the second level.

### Holder Run

In this variant, the holder takes the snap, rises, and runs the ball. The holder reads a predetermined running lane — typically to the edge where the defense has vacated coverage to rush the kick. The holder run requires the holder to be athletic enough to beat defenders to the edge and tough enough to absorb contact near the first-down marker or goal line. Some teams have used their punter as the holder specifically because of their athletic ability to execute fakes.

### Kicker Run or Pass

A less common but occasionally effective fake involves the kicker. After the holder receives the snap and places the ball, the kicker fakes the kicking motion and instead picks up the ball and either runs or throws. Alternatively, the snap may go directly to the kicker, who rolls out and throws to an open receiver. This variant is rare because most kickers lack the running or throwing skills to execute under pressure, but when it works, the element of surprise is enormous.

### Direct Snap to the Upback

Some fake field goal schemes bypass the holder entirely, with the center snapping the ball directly to a player in the backfield — typically the personal protector or a wing player. This player either runs through a gap in the defense or throws a pass to a receiver who has released into a route. The advantage of this scheme is that it does not require the holder to make a play, but the challenge is that the unusual snap trajectory can tip off an alert defense.

## Strategic Considerations

### When to Call It

Coaches consider several factors when deciding whether to attempt a fake field goal. The distance to the first down or end zone is paramount — fakes are most viable when the needed yardage is short, typically 3 yards or less. Field position matters too: a failed fake near the opponent's goal line results in a turnover at the 20-yard line (or wherever the ball is placed), which is less damaging than a failed fake from the opponent's 35-yard line. Game situation — score, time remaining, and momentum — also influences the decision.

### Reading the Defense

The holder or designated playmaker often has a "live" read before the snap. If the defense shows a particular alignment that is vulnerable to the fake, the holder may call the fake at the line of scrimmage using a predetermined audible or signal. Conversely, if the defense is aligned in a way that takes away the fake — for example, dropping a player into coverage rather than committing to the rush — the holder checks out of the fake and the team kicks the field goal as planned.

### Selling the Fake

Execution of the fake requires all 11 players to sell the deception. The kicker must go through their normal pre-kick routine. The offensive line must block as though protecting for a kick. The snap and hold must look identical to a standard field goal operation. Any deviation — a lineman turning to block downfield too early, the kicker breaking routine, or the holder rushing the snap — can alert the defense and compromise the play.

## Defending the Fake Field Goal

Defensive coordinators prepare for fake field goals by assigning a "spy" player — often an outside defender — to watch the holder rather than rushing. This player is responsible for recognizing the fake and making a play on the ball carrier or covering a potential receiver. Additionally, some defenses assign a defender to remain in zone coverage on the outside, specifically to take away the flat route that is the most common target of a holder pass.

## Level Differences

### High School

Fake field goals are effective at the high school level because many teams lack dedicated field goal block units and have less film study to anticipate trick plays. High school holders and kickers may be multi-sport athletes with the skills to execute fakes.

### College (NCAA)

College football features well-designed fake field goals, and many programs practice them weekly. The play is a regular part of the special teams game plan, and coaches may install multiple fake options for different defensive looks.

### NFL

NFL fake field goals are rare due to the sophistication of professional defenses and the high cost of failure. When they occur, they are typically reserved for critical moments. Some of the most memorable NFL moments have come from fake field goals, including Dan Marino's famous fake spike followed by a touchdown pass, which while technically an offensive play, captures the same spirit of deception.

The fake field goal embodies the chess match at the heart of football, rewarding teams that combine preparation, deception, and precise execution.
