## Overview

Return blocking is the engine that powers every successful kick and punt return. Without coordinated, disciplined blocking, even the most talented returner has little chance of gaining significant yardage. Return blocking schemes assign each player a specific responsibility — a defender to block, a lane to create, or a wall to join — and when all 10 blockers execute their assignments, the result is a seam through which the returner can explode for a big gain. Return blocking demands selflessness, physicality, and precise timing, as each block must be initiated and sustained at exactly the right moment.

## Fundamental Blocking Techniques

### Stalk Block

The stalk block is the most common technique used in return blocking. The blocker approaches the coverage defender, mirrors their movement, and engages with the hands, working to sustain the block for as long as possible. The blocker must maintain leverage by staying between the defender and the returner. The key to an effective stalk block is footwork — the blocker must keep their feet moving and stay square to the defender, reacting to any change in direction.

### Seal Block

A seal block involves the blocker positioning themselves between the coverage defender and the intended return lane, sealing the defender away from the path of the returner. The blocker does not need to drive the defender backward; instead, they simply need to wall off the defender by maintaining body position and leverage. Seal blocks are particularly important in wall return schemes, where each blocker must keep their defender on one side of the wall.

### Kick-Out Block

The kick-out block targets the contain player on the coverage unit. The blocker attacks the contain defender from the inside out, driving them toward the sideline and opening the edge for the returner. This block is critical in sideline return schemes, where the returner needs the edge to be turned. The kick-out blocker must be physical and aggressive, attacking the contain player before they can set the edge.

### Cut Block

A cut block involves the blocker diving at the defender's legs to take them to the ground. While legal in some situations, cut blocks on returns are restricted by rules that vary by level. In the NFL, blocks below the waist are prohibited on kick and punt returns outside the tackle box. Cut blocks can be effective when legal because they immediately remove a defender from pursuit, but they carry a risk of a penalty if executed improperly.

## Wall Return Blocking

### Building the Wall

The wall return is the most popular return scheme in modern football, and its success depends entirely on the blockers' ability to form and sustain a horizontal wall. After the kick or punt, designated wall blockers sprint to their assigned positions — typically along one side of the field at or near a predetermined yard line. Each blocker must arrive at their spot, turn to face the coverage, and engage the nearest defender. The wall must be continuous, with no gaps between blockers, so that coverage players cannot slip through.

### Spacing and Timing

Proper spacing is essential in a wall return. Blockers should maintain approximately 3 to 4 yards of separation from each other. If they are too close together, a single coverage player can split two blockers. If they are too far apart, coverage players can run through the gaps. Timing is equally critical — the wall must be set before the returner arrives. A wall that forms too late forces the returner to slow down or improvise, negating the scheme's advantage.

### Running Behind the Wall

The returner's job in a wall return is to run laterally behind the wall, using the line of blockers as a shield. The returner reads the wall as it engages the coverage, looking for the first opening to turn upfield. Patience is key — a returner who cuts upfield too early may run into unblocked defenders, while one who stays behind the wall too long may be caught from behind.

## Middle Return Blocking

### Double-Team and Combination Blocks

Middle return schemes rely on double-team blocks at the point of attack to create a vertical lane up the center of the field. Two blockers converge on the most dangerous coverage players — typically the interior coverage players with the best lanes to the returner — and drive them laterally to widen the seam. After the initial double-team, one blocker may peel off to pick up a secondary threat while the other sustains the primary block.

### Aiming Point

In a middle return, the blockers create a lane centered around a predetermined aiming point — typically the middle of the field at a specific yard line. All blocking assignments are designed to funnel defenders away from this aiming point, and the returner hits the lane at full speed. The middle return is a power scheme that rewards physical, aggressive blocking.

## Special Considerations

### Penalties

Holding and illegal block penalties are the most common infractions on return plays. Blockers must keep their hands inside the defender's frame and avoid grabbing jersey material. A holding penalty on a long return negates the gain and can be one of the most deflating plays in a game. Coaches drill proper hand placement and technique to minimize penalty risk.

### Communication

Pre-snap communication is essential. Blockers must know their assignment based on the return called. Many teams use wristbands with return scheme codes, sideline signals, or predetermined calls to communicate which return is active. Any miscommunication — a single blocker running the wrong scheme — can collapse the entire return.

## Level Differences

### High School

High school return blocking is often the weakest phase of the kicking game. Players may struggle with the timing and spacing required for wall returns, leading many coaches to rely on simpler middle or wedge return concepts.

### College (NCAA)

College return blocking is well-coached and technically sound. Wall returns dominate, and players dedicate significant practice time to perfecting their assignments and timing.

### NFL

NFL return blocking is a science. Every player on the return unit is a trained specialist, and blocking assignments are refined based on film study of the opponent's specific coverage tendencies. The margin for error is razor-thin at the professional level.

Effective return blocking transforms the return game from a field position afterthought into a game-changing weapon.
