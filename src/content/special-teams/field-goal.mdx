## Overview

The field goal and the point after touchdown (PAT) are among the most consequential plays in football. A successful field goal awards three points, while a converted PAT adds one point following a touchdown. Though the mechanics appear simple — a snap, a hold, and a kick through the uprights — the field goal operation demands extraordinary precision and timing from three key specialists: the long snapper, the holder, and the kicker. A breakdown at any point in the chain can result in a missed attempt or, worse, a blocked kick that shifts momentum dramatically.

## The Operation

### Snap to Hold to Kick

The ideal field goal operation takes approximately 1.3 seconds from snap to kick. The long snapper delivers the ball roughly 7 to 8 yards back to the holder, who catches it, places it on the ground with the laces facing away from the kicker, and tilts it at the proper angle — all within a fraction of a second. The kicker takes a predetermined number of steps in an approach pattern, plants the non-kicking foot beside the ball, and strikes it with the instep of the kicking foot. The ball must clear the line of scrimmage quickly, typically reaching a height of at least 10 feet within the first few yards of flight to avoid being blocked.

### Alignment and Blocking

The offensive line sets up in a tight formation to maximize protection. The guards and tackles are responsible for sealing the interior gaps, while the wing players (typically tight ends or fullbacks) protect the edges. Each blocker must maintain leverage and hand placement to prevent defenders from penetrating the line and getting a hand on the ball. The protection scheme is passive — blockers do not fire off the ball but rather absorb the rush — because any movement forward would result in an illegal formation penalty.

## Point After Touchdown (PAT)

### Traditional Extra Point

The PAT has historically been one of the highest-percentage plays in football. Prior to the 2015 NFL rule change, the extra point was snapped from the 2-yard line, making it a virtual certainty. The NFL moved the PAT snap to the 15-yard line, turning it into a 33-yard kick and introducing meaningful uncertainty. The conversion rate dropped from over 99 percent to approximately 94 percent in the first season after the change.

### Two-Point Conversion Alternative

Teams may elect to attempt a two-point conversion instead of kicking the PAT. The offense lines up at the 2-yard line (3-yard line in college) and must advance the ball into the end zone on a single play from scrimmage. The decision to attempt a two-point conversion is driven by game situation, score differential, and statistical models that calculate the expected value of each option.

## Kicking Mechanics

### The Soccer-Style Approach

Nearly all modern kickers use a soccer-style approach, striking the ball with the instep rather than the toe. This technique, popularized in the 1960s and 1970s, allows for greater accuracy and distance. The kicker approaches at an angle, typically 2 to 3 steps back and 1 to 2 steps to the side. The plant foot is placed beside the ball, pointing toward the target, and the kicking leg swings through in a fluid arc. Follow-through is essential — the kicking leg should finish high, with the hips rotating through the target.

### Distance and Accuracy

NFL kickers routinely convert field goals from 50 yards or beyond, with the current NFL record standing at 66 yards, set by Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens in 2021. College and high school kickers generally have shorter effective ranges due to leg strength and development. Wind, weather, altitude, and field surface all affect kicking distance and accuracy. Kickers at higher altitudes, such as Denver's Mile High Stadium, benefit from thinner air that reduces drag on the ball.

## Blocking Field Goals

Defensive teams employ several tactics to block field goals. The most common approach involves overloading one side of the offensive line to create a free rusher. Some teams designate specific athletes — typically defensive ends or outside linebackers with long wingspans and explosive leaps — as their primary block specialists. The block point, where the defender's hand meets the ball's trajectory, is typically 3 to 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Timing is critical; the defender must anticipate the snap count and get off the ball instantly while avoiding a roughing-the-kicker penalty.

### Ice the Kicker

Calling a timeout just before the snap — commonly known as "icing" the kicker — is a widely used psychological tactic. The theory is that the timeout disrupts the kicker's rhythm and forces them to contemplate the pressure of the moment. Statistical analysis of icing produces mixed results, with some studies suggesting it has a modest negative effect on kicking accuracy and others finding no significant impact.

## Level Differences

### High School

High school field goals are attempted less frequently, and effective range is generally shorter, often maxing out around 35 to 40 yards for most kickers. The uprights are the same width as college (23 feet 4 inches), and the PAT is attempted from the 3-yard line in most states.

### College (NCAA)

College kickers face wider hash marks than their NFL counterparts, which means kicks from the hash require more directional accuracy. The uprights are the same width as high school. College PATs are kicked from the 3-yard line, making them shorter than the NFL equivalent.

### NFL

The NFL's narrower hash marks reduce the angle of most field goal attempts compared to college, but the PAT distance increase has added a new strategic dimension. NFL kickers are the most accurate and powerful in the sport, and the field goal operation is refined to a precise science at the professional level.

The field goal and PAT remain fundamental elements of football scoring, and the specialists who execute these plays carry an outsized influence on game outcomes relative to the few seconds they spend on the field.
