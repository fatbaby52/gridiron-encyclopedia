## Overview

The kickoff is one of football's most pivotal and explosive plays. It opens the game, starts the second half, and follows every score. While it may appear straightforward — one team kicks the ball and the other tries to return it — the kickoff involves intricate scheming on both sides. Coverage units must maintain disciplined lane integrity while sprinting downfield at full speed, and return teams must coordinate blocking assignments to create a seam for the returner. The kickoff also carries the highest injury rate of any play in football, prompting significant rule changes in recent years across all levels of the sport.

## Rules

The kicking team places the ball on a tee at its own 35-yard line in the NFL and college football. In high school football, the kickoff is taken from the 40-yard line. The kicking team must wait for the referee's whistle before initiating the play, and all players except the kicker must remain behind the ball until it is kicked.

### Touchback Rules

If the kick travels into the end zone and the returner elects not to bring it out, or if the ball sails out of the back of the end zone, a touchback is declared. In the NFL, touchbacks on kickoffs place the ball at the receiving team's 25-yard line. College football also awards the ball at the 25 following a touchback. High school rules generally place the touchback at the 20-yard line, though this varies by state association. The distinction in touchback placement is a key strategic consideration for kickers and coaches when deciding how deep to kick.

### Onside Kicks

An onside kick is an intentional short kick designed for the kicking team to recover possession. The ball must travel at least 10 yards before the kicking team may legally touch it, unless a receiving team player touches it first. Onside kicks are typically attempted in late-game situations when a team is trailing and needs to regain possession. Surprise onside kicks, attempted when the opposing team is not expecting them, historically have a much higher recovery rate than expected onside kicks. Recent NFL rule changes have prohibited running starts for the coverage team on onside kicks, significantly reducing their success rate.

## Coverage Units

Effective kickoff coverage depends on disciplined lane assignments. Each member of the coverage unit is responsible for maintaining a specific lane as they sprint downfield. The lanes are typically numbered from the sideline inward, and each player must stay within their designated corridor to prevent the returner from finding a seam.

### Lanes and Contain

The players nearest the sidelines are the "contain" players. Their job is to force the returner back toward the middle of the field where the rest of the coverage unit can converge. If a contain player overruns the play or gets blocked inside, the returner can bounce the return to the sideline for a big gain. The interior coverage players fill their lanes and work to close any gaps. The kicker often serves as the safety, the last line of defense if the returner breaks through the initial wave.

## Return Schemes

Return teams employ a variety of blocking schemes to create running lanes for the returner.

- **Wedge Return**: Blockers form a wedge-shaped wall in front of the returner, aiming to create a central seam. Recent rule changes have limited the traditional wedge to only two players locking together in the NFL.
- **Wall Return**: Blockers form a lateral wall across the field, and the returner runs behind the wall toward a sideline. This scheme aims to seal off one side of the field entirely.
- **Middle Return**: Blockers set up to create a lane directly up the middle of the field, relying on double-team blocks at the point of attack.
- **Reverse/Misdirection**: The initial returner fakes one direction while a teammate receives a handoff or lateral going the opposite way. These are high-risk, high-reward schemes.

## Rule Changes

Player safety concerns have driven significant changes to kickoff rules over the past decade.

### Recent Safety Changes

The NFL moved the kickoff spot from the 30-yard line to the 35 in 2011, resulting in a dramatic increase in touchbacks. Wedge blocks of three or more players were banned. Running head starts for coverage players have been limited. These changes collectively reduced the number of high-speed collisions on kickoffs.

### The NFL's Dynamic Kickoff (2024)

The NFL introduced a radically redesigned kickoff format for the 2024 season. Under this format, the kicking team lines up at the receiving team's 40-yard line, while the kicker still kicks from the 35. The receiving team sets up in a "landing zone" between its own 20- and 35-yard lines. Neither team may move until the ball hits the ground or is caught by a returner in the landing zone. This format was designed to increase returns while reducing high-speed collisions, and it drew inspiration from the XFL's kickoff rules.

## Level Differences

### High School

High school kickoffs are taken from the 40-yard line. Touchbacks are placed at the 20-yard line in most states. Many state associations have adopted fair-catch rules on kickoffs to reduce injuries, allowing a fair catch inside the 25-yard line to result in a touchback.

### College (NCAA)

College kickoffs originate from the 35-yard line. The NCAA adopted a rule allowing a fair catch inside the 25-yard line to result in a touchback, significantly reducing returns. Onside kick rules mirror the NFL in requiring the ball to travel 10 yards.

### NFL

The NFL's dynamic kickoff format represents the most dramatic departure from the traditional kickoff. The professional game has been the most aggressive in altering kickoff rules due to injury data, with the league continuously experimenting to find a balance between player safety and maintaining the kickoff as a meaningful play.

Understanding kickoff strategy at every level is essential for coaches and players, as it can directly affect field position and momentum — two of the most important factors in winning football games.
