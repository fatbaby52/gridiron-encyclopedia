## Overview

The battle between gunners and vise players is one of the most physical and technically demanding matchups in football. Gunners — the players who line up wide in the punt formation and sprint downfield to tackle the returner — must defeat multiple blockers and cover 40 to 50 yards in under 4 seconds. Vise players — the return team's designated gunner jammers — are tasked with slowing, rerouting, and physically disrupting the gunner to buy time for the return to develop. This one-on-one or two-on-one chess match unfolds on every punt, and the winner often determines whether the punt return gains 5 yards or 50. Understanding the techniques used by both sides reveals one of football's most specialized and underappreciated skill sets.

## Gunner Techniques

### Release Moves

The gunner's first challenge is getting off the line of scrimmage against one or two vise players trying to jam them. Several release techniques are essential.

**Speed Release**: The gunner sprints to the outside, using pure speed to get around the vise player before they can establish contact. This works when the vise player aligns head-up or slightly inside, giving the gunner a free outside lane. The speed release requires elite acceleration and the ability to corner tight without losing speed.

**Swim Move**: Borrowed from pass-rushing technique, the swim move involves the gunner attacking the vise player with an inside arm over the top while using the outside arm to push down on the blocker's shoulder. This move is effective when the vise player gets hands on the gunner, as it allows the gunner to cross over the blocker's body and continue downfield.

**Rip Move**: The rip involves the gunner driving an arm under the vise player's arm and ripping upward while turning their body to slide past the block. The rip is particularly effective against vise players who extend their arms for a punch, as it exploits the space created under the extended arms.

**Hesitation and Go**: The gunner takes a deliberate first step to one side, freezing the vise player, then explodes in the opposite direction. This change of direction is effective against vise players who are coached to mirror the gunner's initial movement. The hesitation must be convincing enough to commit the blocker without wasting too much time.

**Bull Rush**: When all else fails, the gunner can lower their shoulder and drive directly through the vise player. This power technique sacrifices finesse for brute force and works best when the vise player is smaller or poorly positioned. The gunner must keep their legs driving and maintain forward momentum through contact.

### Downfield Navigation

After clearing the line of scrimmage, the gunner must navigate the second level, where additional blockers may be set up as part of the return scheme. The gunner must identify potential blockers in their path and use avoidance techniques — stutter steps, direction changes, or spin moves — to stay free. The gunner must also track the ball in the air and adjust their angle to arrive at the catch point.

### Tackling in Space

Arriving at the returner is only half the battle. The gunner must then make a tackle in open space against one of the most elusive athletes on the opponent's roster. Proper tackling technique is essential: break down, shorten the stride, keep the eyes on the returner's hips (which do not lie), and drive through the tackle. A missed tackle by the gunner often results in a large return because the gunner is typically the first — and sometimes only — player in position to make the play.

## Vise Techniques

### Single Vise

When one player is assigned to jam the gunner, the vise player typically aligns inside the gunner and uses a two-hand punch at the snap to disrupt the gunner's release. The vise player mirrors the gunner's movement, staying square and driving them toward the sideline or rerouting them inside. The goal is not necessarily to hold the gunner at the line indefinitely but to delay their release by 1 to 2 seconds — enough time for the return scheme to develop.

### Double Vise

In a double vise technique, two players bracket the gunner — one inside and one outside — creating a wall that the gunner must navigate. The inside vise player jams the gunner while the outside vise player walls off any outside release attempt. The double vise is the most effective way to neutralize an elite gunner but comes at a cost: committing two players to the gunner leaves fewer blockers available for the return scheme.

### Legal Boundaries

Vise players must be careful not to commit a holding penalty or an illegal block. They can use their hands and body to impede the gunner within the rules, but they cannot grab the gunner's jersey or drag them to the ground. The block must occur within a legal zone, and once the ball is kicked, the vise player must transition from blocking the gunner to either releasing into the return scheme or continuing to impede the gunner without holding.

## The Coaching Matchup

Punt teams and return teams spend significant film study time analyzing the gunner-vise matchup. Punt coaches look for vise player tendencies — do they favor inside or outside leverage? Do they commit early or react to the gunner's movement? Return coaches study gunner tendencies — do they favor speed or power releases? Do they consistently release to one side? This film work informs the specific techniques and game plans used by both sides.

## Level Differences

### High School

The gunner-vise matchup is less specialized at the high school level, where gunners may be wide receivers or defensive backs pressed into the role without extensive technique training. Vise players are often simply told to "slow down the gunner" without detailed instruction.

### College (NCAA)

College programs train gunners and vise players as specialists, dedicating practice time to release moves and jamming techniques. The talent level at these positions has increased significantly as coaches recognize their impact on field position.

### NFL

The NFL gunner-vise battle is the most refined and competitive version of this matchup. Players like Matthew Slater, Justin Bethel, and Brenden Schooler have built careers as elite gunners, and opposing teams game-plan specifically for them. The vise matchup is charted and analyzed like any other positional battle.

The gunner-vise matchup is a game within the game that directly influences field position and the success of the return game.
