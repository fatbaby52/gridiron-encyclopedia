# Replay and Challenges

The use of instant replay to review and potentially overturn officiating decisions is one of the most significant developments in modern football. Replay systems exist to improve the accuracy of calls on the field, but they have also introduced complex rules, strategic considerations, and ongoing debates about what constitutes sufficient evidence to reverse a decision.

## History of Replay in Football

The NFL first experimented with instant replay in 1986, implementing a system in which a replay official in the press box could review certain plays and signal the referee to reverse a call. This system was used through the 1991 season but was discontinued due to concerns about delays and inconsistency.

Replay returned to the NFL in 1999 with a redesigned system that gave coaches the ability to challenge calls. This version introduced the red challenge flag, which coaches throw onto the field to request a review, and the requirement that a challenge be supported by "clear and obvious" visual evidence in order to overturn a call.

College football adopted its own replay system in 2005. Unlike the NFL, college football does not use coaches' challenges. Instead, a replay official in the press box monitors every play and can initiate a review when there is a question about the call on the field. This approach removes the strategic element from replay but ensures that all questionable plays can be reviewed.

## How the NFL Challenge System Works

In the NFL, each team begins the game with two challenges. If both challenges are successful, the team earns a third challenge. A failed challenge costs the team a timeout. This penalty discourages frivolous challenges and forces coaches to weigh the importance of a potential reversal against the value of a timeout.

Challenges can be used on most plays, but some calls are not subject to coach's challenges. Penalties, for example, generally cannot be challenged. Scoring plays, turnovers, and plays inside the final two minutes of each half are automatically reviewed by the replay official rather than requiring a challenge.

### The Review Process

When a play is challenged or automatically reviewed, the referee goes to a sideline monitor to examine the footage. The referee views multiple angles and speeds of the play. To overturn the call on the field, the referee must find "clear and obvious" evidence that the call was incorrect. If the evidence is inconclusive, the call on the field stands. This standard means that the original call has a built-in advantage, and close calls are less likely to be overturned.

The review process typically takes one to three minutes, though particularly complex reviews can take longer. During the review, both teams remain on the field, and the broadcast shows the replay footage to the television audience.

### What Can Be Reviewed

The NFL has gradually expanded the list of reviewable plays over the years. Currently, the following are among the plays and situations subject to review:

- Whether a pass was complete or incomplete
- Whether a runner was down by contact
- Whether a player stepped out of bounds
- Whether a scoring play crossed the goal line
- Whether a turnover occurred (fumble or interception)
- Placement of the ball relative to a first down or goal line
- Whether the correct number of players were on the field
- Whether the game clock expired before the snap

### What Cannot Be Reviewed

Several types of plays and situations remain outside the scope of replay. Most penalty calls and non-calls cannot be reviewed. The NFL briefly experimented with allowing challenges of pass interference calls and non-calls in 2019, but the experiment was widely considered a failure because referees rarely overturned the calls on the field. The league discontinued pass interference replay after one season.

Judgment calls, such as whether a hit on the quarterback was roughing the passer or whether a receiver was interfered with, are generally not reviewable. This limitation reflects the difficulty of applying an objective "clear and obvious" standard to subjective judgment calls.

## College Football Replay

College football's replay system differs from the NFL's in several important ways. As noted, there is no coach's challenge; the replay official initiates all reviews. This means coaches cannot strategically challenge calls, but it also means that questionable calls are not missed because a coach ran out of challenges or chose not to use one.

The standard for overturning a call in college football is similar to the NFL's: there must be "indisputable video evidence" that the call on the field was wrong. If the evidence is not definitive, the call stands.

College football replay can review a broader set of situations than the NFL in some respects, including targeting penalties, which carry an automatic ejection. The ability to review and overturn targeting calls is important because the penalty is so severe.

## High School Football

Most high school football does not use instant replay due to the cost and infrastructure required. Some state associations have begun experimenting with limited replay in championship games, but it remains uncommon at the high school level.

## Strategic Considerations

The challenge system in the NFL adds a layer of strategy to the game. Coaches must decide not only whether a call was wrong but whether the potential benefit of overturning it is worth the risk of losing a timeout. A challenge early in the game on a minor gain might not be worth the risk, while a challenge on a potential touchdown or turnover is almost always worthwhile.

Coaches often rely on assistant coaches in the press box who have access to television replays to advise them on whether to challenge. The speed of this communication is critical, as there is a limited window after a play in which a challenge can be issued.

## The Ongoing Debate

Replay remains a subject of debate among fans, coaches, and officials. Proponents argue that replay has significantly improved the accuracy of officiating and that fans deserve to have the most important calls made correctly. Critics argue that replay slows the game, introduces inconsistency in what constitutes "clear and obvious" evidence, and has not eliminated controversy despite its intent to do so. The balance between accuracy and pace of play is a tension that football at every level continues to navigate.
