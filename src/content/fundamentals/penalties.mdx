## Overview

Penalties are infractions of the rules that result in yardage being assessed against the offending team. When an official observes a foul, they throw a bright yellow **penalty flag** onto the field. After the play is completed, the referee announces the penalty, the offending team, and the enforcement. The non-offending team typically has the option to **accept or decline** the penalty, choosing whichever result is more advantageous. Penalties serve to maintain fair play, protect player safety, and preserve the integrity of the competition.

## Key Concepts

**Pre-Snap Penalties**

These fouls occur before the ball is snapped and result in a dead-ball penalty, meaning the play does not count.

- **False Start (5 yards):** An offensive player moves illegally before the snap. Any abrupt movement by an offensive lineman or a receiver simulating the start of a play is a false start. This is one of the most common penalties in football.
- **Offside (5 yards):** A defensive player crosses the line of scrimmage and makes contact with an offensive player before the snap, or is in the neutral zone when the ball is snapped. If the defensive player jumps into the neutral zone but gets back before the snap without causing an offensive player to react, no foul is called.
- **Encroachment (5 yards):** A defensive player enters the neutral zone and contacts an offensive player before the snap. This is a dead-ball foul, stopping play immediately.
- **Delay of Game (5 yards):** The offense fails to snap the ball before the play clock expires. This dead-ball foul resets the play.

**Blocking and Contact Penalties**

- **Holding -- Offensive (10 yards):** An offensive player illegally grabs, hooks, or restrains a defensive player who is attempting to disengage. Offensive holding is one of the most frequently called penalties and can negate big plays.
- **Holding -- Defensive (5 yards + automatic first down):** A defensive player grabs and holds an eligible receiver beyond the allowed contact zone. This penalty awards an automatic first down.
- **Illegal Block in the Back (10 yards):** A player blocks an opponent from behind above the waist. This penalty commonly occurs on kick and punt returns.
- **Chop Block (15 yards):** An illegal combination block where one offensive player blocks a defender high while another blocks the same defender low. This is a serious safety-related foul.

**Passing Penalties**

- **Pass Interference -- Defensive (spot foul in NFL / 15 yards in college):** A defensive player significantly hinders an eligible receiver's ability to catch a forward pass. In the NFL, the penalty is enforced at the spot of the foul, which can result in massive yardage. In college and high school, it is a standard 15-yard penalty.
- **Pass Interference -- Offensive (10 yards):** An offensive receiver creates illegal separation from a defender by pushing off or running through the defender while the ball is in the air.
- **Intentional Grounding (loss of down + 10 yards or safety):** The quarterback throws the ball away without a realistic chance of completing the pass to avoid a sack, while inside the tackle box and without throwing the ball past the line of scrimmage.
- **Illegal Contact (5 yards + automatic first down):** In the NFL, a defensive player makes significant contact with an eligible receiver beyond 5 yards from the line of scrimmage. This rule does not exist in college or high school football.

**Personal Fouls (15 yards)**

Personal fouls are severe infractions that endanger player safety and carry a 15-yard penalty. Repeated or egregious personal fouls can result in ejection.

- **Roughing the Passer:** A defender hits the quarterback in an illegal manner after the ball has been released, or drives the quarterback into the ground with excessive force. This penalty also carries an automatic first down.
- **Roughing the Kicker:** A defender makes illegal contact with the punter or kicker during or after the kicking motion.
- **Targeting (college):** A player makes forcible contact against a defenseless opponent to the head or neck area, or leads with the crown of the helmet. Targeting carries an automatic ejection in college football.
- **Unnecessary Roughness:** Any excessive or violent contact deemed unnecessary, including late hits out of bounds, piling on after the play is dead, or striking an opponent.
- **Unsportsmanlike Conduct:** Actions that violate the spirit of fair play, including taunting, excessive celebration (enforcement varies by level), and abusive language toward officials.

## Level Differences

- **High School:** Penalties and enforcement generally mirror college rules, though state associations may implement specific variations. Officials tend to be more instructional, particularly at lower levels of play. Pass interference is a 15-yard penalty.
- **College (NCAA):** The targeting rule, with its mandatory ejection and replay review component, is unique to the college level and was designed to reduce head injuries. Pass interference is a 15-yard penalty regardless of where the foul occurs. The illegal contact rule does not apply.
- **NFL:** Defensive pass interference is a **spot foul**, meaning it is enforced at the location of the infraction. This can result in penalties of 40 yards or more. The NFL also enforces the **illegal contact** rule beyond 5 yards, which does not exist at other levels. Taunting enforcement has been increased in recent seasons, and the roughing-the-passer protections are the most extensive of any level.

## Related Concepts

Penalties are inseparable from the **down-and-distance** system, as most penalties alter the yardage required for a first down or award an automatic first down outright. Understanding penalties is also critical when studying **offensive and defensive positions**, because many infractions are specific to certain positions. Offensive linemen are most susceptible to holding calls, while defensive backs are most likely to be penalized for pass interference and illegal contact.
