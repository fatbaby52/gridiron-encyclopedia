# Overtime Rules

Overtime in football exists to resolve games that are tied at the end of regulation. However, unlike most sports, football does not use a single universal overtime format. The NFL, college football, and high school football each use different overtime systems, reflecting different priorities about fairness, entertainment, and player safety. Understanding these systems is important for appreciating late-game strategy and the decisions coaches make when a game is tied.

## NFL Overtime

The NFL has modified its overtime rules several times, with each revision aimed at addressing perceived fairness issues.

### Current NFL Rules

Under the current NFL overtime rules, a coin toss determines which team receives the ball first. The overtime period is 10 minutes long during the regular season. Both teams are guaranteed at least one possession unless the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown on its first drive. If the first team to possess the ball scores a touchdown, the game is over. If the first team scores a field goal, the other team gets a possession to match or exceed the score. If the second team also scores a field goal, the game continues in a sudden-death format, where the next score of any kind wins.

In the NFL playoffs, the rules were further modified after the 2021 season. Both teams are now guaranteed a possession regardless of what happens on the first drive, unless the game ends on a defensive score such as a safety or a defensive touchdown on the second team's possession. If the score is still tied after both teams have possessed the ball, the game continues in sudden death. Playoff overtime periods are 15 minutes, and there is no limit to the number of overtime periods that can be played.

### History of NFL Overtime

The NFL adopted sudden-death overtime in 1974. Under the original format, the first team to score in any manner won the game. This system was widely criticized because the coin toss winner had a significant statistical advantage: teams that won the toss won approximately 60 percent of overtime games. The team receiving the ball could drive into field goal range and end the game without the other team ever touching the ball.

The first major reform came in 2010 for the playoffs, and it was extended to the regular season in 2012. The modified rule ensured that both teams would get a possession if the first team scored only a field goal. This reduced the coin-toss advantage but did not eliminate it entirely, as a first-drive touchdown still ended the game.

The most recent reform, guaranteeing both teams a possession in the playoffs, was prompted by the 2021 AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills. The Chiefs won the coin toss and scored a touchdown on their first possession, ending one of the most exciting games in NFL history without Josh Allen and the Bills' offense ever getting the ball in overtime.

## College Football Overtime

College football uses a completely different overtime system that eliminates the kickoff entirely.

### How College Overtime Works

After a coin toss, each team gets a possession starting at the opponent's 25-yard line. There is no game clock during overtime; each possession continues until the team scores or turns the ball over. The team that wins the coin toss can choose to go on offense or defense first or can choose which end of the field to play on.

After both teams have had a possession, if the score is tied, another overtime period begins with the other team going first on offense. Starting with the third overtime period, teams must attempt a two-point conversion after scoring a touchdown rather than kicking an extra point. Starting with the third overtime period (as modified in 2021), each team's "possession" is a single two-point conversion attempt from the 3-yard line rather than a full drive from the 25.

### Rationale and Impact

The college overtime system was adopted in 1996 and has generally been praised for its fairness and entertainment value. Because both teams are guaranteed an equal number of possessions, the coin toss has minimal impact on the outcome. The system also guarantees a decisive result, as overtime periods continue until one team leads at the end of a complete round.

The compressed possessions in the third overtime and beyond were introduced to limit the physical toll on players and prevent excessively long games. Before this change, some college overtime games lasted seven or more overtime periods, raising concerns about player safety and game length.

## High School Overtime

High school overtime rules vary by state but generally follow a format similar to college football. Most states use the Kansas Plan, named for its origin in Kansas high school football, which gives each team a possession from the opponent's 10-yard line. The specific starting yard line and rules about two-point conversions vary by state.

## Strategic Implications

Overtime rules significantly influence late-game strategy. In the NFL, a team that is tied late in the fourth quarter must decide whether to play for the tie and go to overtime or take risks to win in regulation. The knowledge that the coin toss matters in NFL overtime can influence decisions about clock management, timeout usage, and whether to attempt a game-winning field goal or play for a potential overtime scenario.

In college football, overtime strategy involves decisions about going first or second on offense (most teams prefer to go second so they know what they need to match), field position considerations, and play-calling adjustments for the compressed field. The two-point conversion rule in later overtime periods adds another layer of strategy, as teams must plan for the possibility that a single play from the 3-yard line will decide the game.
