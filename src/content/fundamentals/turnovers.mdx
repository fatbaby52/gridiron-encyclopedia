# Turnovers

Turnovers are among the most consequential plays in football. A turnover occurs when the offensive team loses possession of the ball to the defense, either through a fumble or an interception. Turnover margin, the difference between turnovers gained and turnovers lost, is one of the strongest statistical predictors of winning in football at every level.

## Fumbles

A fumble occurs when a player who has possession of the ball loses it before being ruled down. Any player on either team can recover a fumble, and the team that recovers gains possession. A fumble can happen to any player carrying the ball: the quarterback, running back, wide receiver, kick returner, or even a defensive player who has gained possession through an interception.

### When Is a Player Down?

The rules for when a player is "down" differ between levels of football. In the NFL, a player must be touched by a defender while any part of his body other than his hands or feet is on the ground. This means a player who trips and falls without being touched can get back up and continue running. In college and high school football, a player is down when any part of his body other than his hands or feet touches the ground, regardless of whether a defender touched him. This distinction significantly affects fumble frequency, as NFL players can lose the ball after going to the ground untouched and have it recovered by the defense.

### Fumble Recovery Rules

When a fumble occurs, any player on the field can attempt to recover it. The ball is live until a player gains clear possession while on the ground or a player who is on his feet secures it. In the NFL, a fumble that goes out of bounds belongs to the team that last had possession, unless the fumble goes forward out of bounds in the end zone, in which case it is a touchback and the defensive team gains possession.

A critical rule involves fumbles in the final two minutes of each half in the NFL. Only the player who fumbled can advance a fumble forward during this period. This rule was instituted after the "Holy Roller" play in 1978, when the Oakland Raiders intentionally fumbled the ball forward to score a game-winning touchdown.

### Forced Fumbles and Strip Techniques

Defenses actively try to create fumbles through stripping techniques. The "punch out" involves a defender punching at the ball while another defender makes the tackle. The "rake" involves pulling the ball out from the carrier's arms. The "tomahawk" targets the ball from above. Modern defensive coaching places significant emphasis on these techniques, and turnover drills are a standard part of every team's practice routine.

## Interceptions

An interception occurs when a defensive player catches a pass intended for an offensive receiver. The defender who makes the interception can advance the ball, potentially returning it for a touchdown. An interception returned for a touchdown is commonly called a "pick-six."

### Interception Rules

For an interception to be valid, the defender must meet the same requirements for a catch as an offensive receiver. In the NFL, this means two feet in bounds and control of the ball through the process of the catch. In college football, only one foot is required. If a defender and an offensive player both gain simultaneous possession of a pass, the offense retains possession, a rule known as "simultaneous catch."

Interceptions can occur in the end zone. If a defender intercepts a pass in his own end zone and is tackled there, the result is a touchback and the ball is placed at the 20-yard line (NFL) or 25-yard line (college). The defender may also attempt to return the interception out of the end zone.

### Reading the Quarterback

The best ball-hawking defenders anticipate throws by reading the quarterback's eyes, body language, and tendencies. Film study is essential for interceptions, as defenders who recognize formations and route concepts can position themselves in passing lanes before the ball is thrown. Some of the most prolific interceptors in football history, such as Ed Reed and Charles Woodson, were masters of deception, baiting quarterbacks into throws that looked open but were actually traps.

## Turnover on Downs

While not technically a turnover in the traditional sense, a "turnover on downs" occurs when the offense fails to gain enough yardage for a first down on fourth down. The defensive team takes over possession at the spot of the ball. Unlike fumbles and interceptions, a turnover on downs does not provide the defense with an opportunity to advance the ball immediately.

## The Impact of Turnovers

Statistical analysis consistently shows that turnover margin is one of the strongest predictors of winning. Teams that win the turnover battle win approximately 70 to 80 percent of their games. This is because turnovers not only take away a possession from the offense but also give the defense a possession, creating a two-possession swing. When the defensive team scores on the turnover, the swing is even more dramatic.

Coaches at every level emphasize ball security for the offense and takeaway skills for the defense. The best teams are those that protect the ball on offense while creating turnovers on defense, a combination that is often the difference between winning and losing seasons.
