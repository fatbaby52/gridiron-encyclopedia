## Overview

A standard American football game is divided into four timed quarters, separated by a halftime intermission. The team with the most points at the end of regulation wins. If the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, the game proceeds to overtime. Understanding the structure of a football game is essential for appreciating the strategic decisions coaches and players make throughout each phase of competition.

## Key Concepts

**Quarters and Game Clock**

Each game consists of four quarters. The game clock runs down during most plays but stops in specific situations, such as incomplete passes, out-of-bounds plays, penalties, timeouts, and certain scoring plays. The clock operator, positioned in the press box, controls the official game clock under the direction of the referees.

**Halftime**

Halftime occurs between the second and third quarters. Teams retreat to their locker rooms for rest, strategic adjustments, and coaching review. The halftime break gives coaching staffs an opportunity to analyze first-half performance and modify their game plans for the second half.

**Coin Toss and Possession**

Before the game begins, a coin toss determines which team receives the opening kickoff and which end of the field each team defends. The team that defers its choice to the second half will receive the kickoff to start the third quarter. Teams switch ends of the field after each quarter.

**Overtime**

When regulation ends in a tie, overtime procedures determine the winner. The specifics vary by level, but all overtime formats provide each team an opportunity to possess the ball and score.

- **Pre-game coin toss** determines first possession and field choice
- **Kickoffs** start each half and follow every score
- **Two-minute warnings** automatically stop the clock before the end of the second and fourth quarters
- **Timeouts** are a critical resource, with each team receiving a set number per half
- **Play clock** governs the time between plays, requiring the offense to snap the ball before it expires

**Clock Management**

Strategic use of the clock is one of the most important elements of football. Teams with a lead late in the game will run the ball and stay in bounds to keep the clock moving. Trailing teams use incomplete passes, sideline routes, and timeouts to stop the clock and preserve time. The **two-minute drill** is a well-practiced offensive strategy designed to score quickly when time is running out.

## Level Differences

- **High School:** Games consist of four **12-minute quarters**. Overtime rules vary by state but commonly use the Kansas Plan, where each team gets one possession from the opponent's 10-yard line. Halftime is typically 15 to 20 minutes. Each team receives three timeouts per half.
- **College (NCAA):** Games feature four **15-minute quarters**. Overtime uses a unique alternating-possession format starting at the opponent's 25-yard line. Beginning with the third overtime period, teams must attempt a two-point conversion after touchdowns. Halftime lasts 20 minutes. Each team receives three timeouts per half.
- **NFL:** Games also have four **15-minute quarters**. Overtime in the regular season is a single 10-minute period; if still tied, the game ends in a tie. In the playoffs, play continues until a winner is determined. The NFL overtime format was updated so that both teams are guaranteed a possession unless the first team scores a touchdown on its opening drive (rules updated further in 2024 to guarantee both teams a possession regardless). Halftime lasts approximately 12 to 15 minutes during the regular season. Each team receives three timeouts per half.

## Related Concepts

Understanding game structure provides the foundation for studying **downs and distance**, which governs possession within each drive, and **clock management strategy**, which becomes increasingly critical in the closing minutes of each half. Familiarity with the **field layout** and **penalty enforcement** also helps clarify how game flow is affected by stoppages and yardage adjustments.
