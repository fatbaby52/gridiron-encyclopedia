# Scoring in Football

Understanding how scoring works is the foundation for understanding football. While the basic concept is simple -- advance the ball into the opponent's end zone -- the rules governing scoring in football are more nuanced than most casual fans realize. Different methods of scoring carry different point values, and the strategic decisions surrounding scoring opportunities are among the most important in the game.

## Touchdown (6 Points)

A touchdown is the most valuable scoring play in football, worth six points. A touchdown is scored when a player carries the ball across the opponent's goal line, catches a pass while in the end zone, or recovers a loose ball in the end zone. The key rule is that the ball must break the plane of the goal line while the player is in possession and in bounds. A player does not need to be standing in the end zone; if any part of the ball crosses the plane of the goal line while the player has possession, it is a touchdown.

In the NFL, a player catching a pass in the end zone must complete the catch by maintaining control of the ball through the process of going to the ground. This rule has been the subject of significant controversy and multiple revisions. In college football, a player only needs to have one foot in bounds while possessing the ball, while the NFL requires two feet in bounds.

A touchdown can also be scored by the defense. If a defensive player intercepts a pass or recovers a fumble and returns it to the opponent's end zone, it is a defensive touchdown worth the same six points. Special teams touchdowns can occur on punt returns, kickoff returns, or blocked kicks recovered in the end zone.

## Extra Point and Two-Point Conversion

After a touchdown, the scoring team has the option to attempt either an extra point kick or a two-point conversion. The extra point, also known as the point after touchdown (PAT), is a kick through the uprights. In the NFL, the PAT is attempted from the 15-yard line, making it a 33-yard kick. In college and high school football, the PAT is attempted from the 3-yard line (college) or the 3-yard line (high school), making it a shorter and more routine kick.

The two-point conversion is a single play from scrimmage, attempted from the 2-yard line in the NFL and the 3-yard line in college football. The offense must cross the goal line by running or passing, just as in scoring a touchdown. Two-point conversions are strategically significant because they can affect the mathematics of a game. A team trailing by 8 points with a touchdown, for example, needs a two-point conversion to tie, while a team trailing by 7 needs only the extra point.

Defensive teams can also score on extra-point and two-point conversion attempts. In college football, if the defense intercepts a pass or recovers a fumble during a two-point conversion attempt and returns it the length of the field, the defensive team is awarded two points. The NFL adopted a similar rule, allowing defensive returns on conversion attempts.

## Field Goal (3 Points)

A field goal is worth three points and is scored by kicking the ball through the uprights (the vertical bars extending above the crossbar at each end of the field). Field goals are typically attempted on fourth down when the offense is close enough for the kicker to have a reasonable chance of success but unable to score a touchdown.

The ball is snapped to a holder, who places it on the ground for the kicker. The distance of a field goal is calculated from the spot of the kick to the goalpost, plus the 10 yards of the end zone and approximately 7 yards for the snap. So a kick from the 20-yard line is a 37-yard field goal.

Field goal range varies by kicker and level of play. In the NFL, most kickers are reliable from 50 yards and closer, with some capable of making kicks from 60 yards or more. High school kickers typically have a shorter range, making field goal decisions more dependent on the specific kicker's ability.

## Safety (2 Points)

A safety is worth two points and is scored when the offensive team is tackled, goes out of bounds, or commits a foul in its own end zone. After a safety, the team that was scored upon must kick the ball to the team that scored. This makes a safety uniquely valuable: it is the only scoring play that results in the scoring team also gaining possession of the ball.

Safeties are relatively rare, but they can be game-changing. A safety can also be scored if the offense commits an intentional grounding penalty in its own end zone or if a punt is blocked and goes out of bounds in the end zone.

## Strategic Implications

The point values of each scoring method create a rich strategic landscape. The decision to attempt a field goal versus going for a touchdown on fourth down has become one of the most analyzed decisions in football, with analytics increasingly favoring aggressive fourth-down attempts. The choice between an extra point and a two-point conversion depends on the game situation, the score differential, and the team's confidence in its short-yardage offense. Understanding the scoring system is essential for understanding the strategic decisions that define every football game.
