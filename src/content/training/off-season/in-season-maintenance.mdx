# In-Season Training & Maintenance

The off-season builds the engine. The in-season keeps it running. This distinction is fundamental to understanding why in-season training matters and how it differs from every other phase of the annual plan. The football season subjects the body to an extraordinary volume of physical stress — practices, games, travel, contact, and the relentless accumulation of micro-trauma that defines the sport. Without a deliberate in-season training program, the strength, power, and lean mass developed over months of off-season work erode steadily from Week 1 to the postseason.

Research in sports science has consistently demonstrated that athletes who cease resistance training during a competitive season experience significant declines in maximal strength (up to 10-15 percent), power output, lean body mass, and sprint speed. These losses are not merely cosmetic — they translate directly to diminished on-field performance, increased injury susceptibility, and accelerated physical decline over the course of a long season.

The challenge of in-season training is not conceptual but practical: how does a coaching staff maintain the physical qualities their athletes need while managing the fatigue, soreness, and injury risk inherent in a sport as violent as football? The answer lies in three core principles — reduced volume, maintained intensity, and strategic scheduling — applied within the game-day-minus system that has become the industry standard across all levels of football.

## The Core Principle: Reduced Volume, Maintained Intensity

The single most important concept in in-season training is that **volume decreases but intensity is preserved**. This principle is grounded in the physiological reality that maximal strength and power are primarily neural adaptations — they depend on the nervous system's ability to recruit motor units at high rates — and neural adaptations are maintained by brief exposure to high-intensity stimuli, even when total training volume drops substantially.

In practical terms, this means:

- An athlete who squatted 4 sets of 5 at 85 percent during the off-season strength phase may perform 2-3 sets of 3 at 82-88 percent during the season
- Total weekly training volume (measured in total sets, reps, or tonnage) decreases by 40-60 percent relative to the off-season peak
- The heaviest sets in any given session are performed at intensities comparable to off-season training (75-90 percent of 1RM, depending on the day and proximity to game day)
- Accessory work is reduced to one or two exercises per session, focused on injury prevention and addressing individual weaknesses
- Training sessions are shorter: 30-45 minutes for the lifting component, compared to 60-75 minutes during the off-season

The athlete who attempts to maintain off-season training volume during the season will overtrain, accumulate fatigue, and increase the risk of injury. Conversely, the athlete who abandons the weight room entirely will lose the physical qualities that made high performance possible in the first place. The in-season program occupies the narrow middle ground between these two extremes.

## The Game-Day-Minus System

The game-day-minus (GD-minus) system is a scheduling framework that organizes all weekly training activities relative to the next game. If the game is on Saturday (as in college football), then Friday is GD-1, Thursday is GD-2, Wednesday is GD-3, and so on. For NFL teams playing on Sunday, Saturday is GD-1, Friday is GD-2, and so forth.

This system provides a consistent structure regardless of the day of the week and allows training intensity, volume, and focus to be precisely calibrated based on proximity to competition.

### Standard GD-Minus Weekly Template

The following template represents a standard in-season week for a team playing on Saturday (college) or Sunday (NFL). High school teams playing Friday night games would shift the schedule accordingly.

**GD-4 (Tuesday for Saturday game / Wednesday for Sunday game)**

This is the highest-intensity training day of the week, positioned far enough from game day to allow full recovery.

- **Lifting focus:** Primary compound movements at high intensity (82-90% of training max), low volume (2-3 sets of 2-4 reps)
- **Practice focus:** Full-speed, full-pad installation of the game plan; highest practice intensity of the week
- **Conditioning:** None beyond practice demands; the practice itself provides sufficient metabolic stress
- **Recovery:** Post-practice nutrition, cold water immersion, soft-tissue work

**Sample GD-4 Lift:**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Intensity |
|---|---|---|
| Hang Clean | 3 x 2 | 80-85% |
| Back Squat | 3 x 3 | 82-88% |
| Bench Press | 3 x 3 | 82-88% |
| Weighted Pull-Up | 2 x 5 | Moderate-Heavy |
| Hamstring Curl | 2 x 8 | Moderate |

**GD-3 (Wednesday for Saturday game / Thursday for Sunday game)**

A moderate training day that balances physical preparation with continued tactical installation.

- **Lifting focus:** Moderate intensity (70-78% of training max), moderate volume (3 sets of 5-6 reps), emphasis on secondary movements and unilateral work
- **Practice focus:** Continuation of game-plan installation; situational work (red zone, third down, two-minute)
- **Conditioning:** Light positional conditioning or movement circuits
- **Recovery:** Standard protocols

**Sample GD-3 Lift:**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Intensity |
|---|---|---|
| DB RDL | 3 x 6 | Moderate |
| DB Incline Press | 3 x 6 | Moderate |
| Single-Leg Squat | 2 x 8/leg | Moderate |
| Cable Row | 2 x 10 | Moderate |
| Band Pull-Apart | 2 x 15 | Light |

**GD-2 (Thursday for Saturday game / Friday for Sunday game)**

A low-stress day focused on movement quality, injury prevention, and mental preparation.

- **Lifting focus:** None or very light (bodyweight circuits, band work, activation exercises only)
- **Practice focus:** Walk-through tempo; mental reps and alignment checks; reduced volume
- **Conditioning:** None
- **Recovery:** Aggressive recovery protocols — cold water immersion, compression therapy, massage, sleep optimization

**GD-1 (Friday for Saturday game / Saturday for Sunday game)**

No lifting. Practice is limited to a brief walk-through or mental rehearsal. The day is dedicated to rest, travel (if applicable), and mental preparation.

**Game Day**

Competition.

**GD+1 (Sunday for Saturday game / Monday for Sunday game)**

The day after the game is dedicated entirely to recovery.

- **Lifting focus:** None for athletes who played significant snaps; optional light flush session (10-15 minutes of low-intensity movement) for reserves
- **Practice focus:** Light movement, walk-through review of previous game, film review
- **Recovery:** This is the most important recovery day of the week — cold water immersion, compression therapy, manual therapy, and nutritional replenishment
- **Mental:** Film review of individual performance, initial preparation for next opponent

**GD+2 (Monday for Saturday game / Tuesday for Sunday game)**

Transition day. The body is still recovering from game-day stress, but active recovery and low-intensity movement help accelerate the process.

- **Lifting focus:** Optional light session focused on upper body (if the GD-4 session emphasizes lower body) or injury-prevention accessory work
- **Practice focus:** Installation begins for the next game; intensity is low to moderate
- **Recovery:** Continued emphasis on sleep, nutrition, and soft-tissue work

## Level-Specific Implementation

### High School In-Season Training

High school programs face unique constraints: limited weight room time (often shared with other sports), shorter practice periods, and a wide range of athlete training ages. The in-season lifting program at the high school level is typically simpler and less frequent than at the college or professional level.

**Standard high school in-season approach:**
- Two lifting sessions per week (typically Monday and Wednesday for a Friday game)
- Sessions last 25-35 minutes
- Focus on the primary compound lifts: squat, bench press, power clean, and one or two accessories
- Intensity is moderate to high (75-85% of training max)
- Volume is minimal: 2-3 sets of 3-5 reps on primary movements

The head strength coach or the position coach who oversees the weight room must communicate clearly with the head football coach to ensure that lifting sessions are scheduled appropriately within the practice plan. A common mistake at the high school level is treating weight room time as expendable — the first thing cut when practice runs long. Consistency is more important than any individual session; cutting lifting sessions erodes the physical gains that required months to build.

**Sample High School In-Season Week (Friday Game):**

| Day | Activity |
|---|---|
| Monday | Lift (Primary, High Intensity) + Practice |
| Tuesday | Practice (Full Speed) |
| Wednesday | Lift (Secondary, Moderate) + Practice |
| Thursday | Walk-Through / Light Practice |
| Friday | Game |
| Saturday | Rest / Recovery |
| Sunday | Rest |

### College In-Season Training

College programs benefit from full-time strength staffs, dedicated facilities, and athletes who are training four to five years within the same system. In-season training is more structured and closely monitored than at the high school level.

**Standard college in-season approach:**
- Two to three lifting sessions per week, scheduled within the GD-minus framework
- Sessions last 30-45 minutes
- Primary movements are trained at 80-90 percent intensity on the high day (GD-4) and 70-78 percent on the moderate day (GD-3)
- GPS and force plate data are used to monitor training load and identify athletes who need modified programming
- Position-specific accessory work addresses the unique demands of each role (e.g., neck strengthening for linemen, hip mobility for defensive backs, shoulder prehabilitation for quarterbacks)

### NFL In-Season Training

Professional in-season training is the most individualized and technology-driven of any level. Each athlete may have a slightly different program based on age, injury history, playing time, and position demands.

**Standard NFL in-season approach:**
- Two lifting sessions per week (GD-4 and GD-3 in the standard model, though some teams experiment with three lighter sessions)
- Sessions are brief (25-40 minutes) and highly focused
- Veteran players often have modified programs that account for chronic conditions and accumulated wear
- Recovery modalities are used aggressively throughout the week: whole-body cryotherapy, normatec compression, float tanks, and manual therapy are standard
- Nutritional support is comprehensive: team chefs prepare meals, post-practice nutrition stations are stocked with recovery shakes and prepared foods, and individual meal plans are provided for athletes with specific goals

## Recovery Protocols Between Games

Recovery is not a passive process — it is an active discipline that requires planning, consistency, and intentionality. The quality of recovery between games directly influences performance in the next contest and cumulative durability across the season.

### Immediate Post-Game (0-2 Hours)

- **Nutrition:** A recovery meal or shake containing 40-60 grams of protein and 80-120 grams of carbohydrate within 30-60 minutes of the final whistle. This window is critical for glycogen replenishment and initiating muscle repair.
- **Hydration:** Fluid replacement targeting 150 percent of sweat losses. Electrolyte-enriched beverages are preferred over plain water.
- **Cold water immersion:** 8-12 minutes at 50-59 degrees Fahrenheit to reduce acute inflammation and perceived soreness. While the research on cold water immersion is nuanced, the practical consensus among professional staffs is that it provides meaningful recovery benefits in the acute post-game window.
- **Compression:** Pneumatic compression devices (such as NormaTec boots) applied for 20-30 minutes to enhance venous return and reduce swelling.

### 24-48 Hours Post-Game

- **Active recovery:** Light movement — walking, cycling, swimming, or a mobility flow — at very low intensity to promote blood flow without adding mechanical stress.
- **Manual therapy:** Massage or soft-tissue mobilization to address areas of acute soreness or tightness.
- **Sleep:** The most powerful recovery tool available. Athletes should target 8-10 hours of sleep per night during the season, with napping encouraged when schedules permit. Sleep quality is enhanced by consistent sleep-wake times, a cool and dark sleeping environment, and avoidance of screens and stimulants in the hours before bed.
- **Nutrition:** Continued emphasis on high-quality protein distributed across four to six meals, ample carbohydrate to replenish glycogen stores, and anti-inflammatory foods (fatty fish, berries, leafy greens, turmeric).

### 48-72 Hours Post-Game

- The athlete transitions from recovery mode to preparation mode
- Training intensity begins to increase as the body recovers from game-day stress
- Mental preparation for the next opponent begins in earnest
- Any lingering soreness or minor injuries are managed through targeted treatment from the athletic training staff

## Managing Fatigue and Injury

The in-season accumulation of fatigue is the single greatest threat to sustained performance and health. Fatigue is multifactorial — it encompasses physical tissue damage, neural fatigue, hormonal disruption, psychological stress, and sleep disruption. Effective fatigue management requires a comprehensive approach.

**Monitoring tools and strategies:**

- **Subjective wellness questionnaires:** Athletes rate perceived fatigue, soreness, sleep quality, mood, and stress on a daily basis. Trend analysis of these scores identifies athletes who are sliding toward overreaching before objective markers decline.
- **Training load monitoring:** GPS units and accelerometers track total distance, high-speed running distance, acceleration and deceleration counts, and player load during practices and games. This data helps coaches modulate practice intensity for athletes who are accumulating excessive load.
- **Force plate assessments:** Countermovement jump testing on force plates provides sensitive, objective measures of neuromuscular readiness. A decline in peak force, rate of force development, or flight-time-to-contraction-time ratio signals that the athlete needs reduced training stress or additional recovery.
- **Heart rate variability (HRV):** Morning HRV measurements reflect autonomic nervous system balance and provide an indicator of recovery status. Chronically suppressed HRV suggests accumulated fatigue.
- **Blood biomarkers:** At the professional level, periodic blood panels measuring testosterone, cortisol, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, and other markers provide insight into hormonal status, muscle damage, and systemic inflammation.

**Practical fatigue management strategies:**

- **Auto-regulation of training loads.** On days when an athlete is demonstrably fatigued (low wellness scores, poor jump metrics, elevated HRV suppression), the strength coach should reduce training intensity or volume rather than rigidly adhering to the pre-written program.
- **Strategic load management in practice.** Head coaches and coordinators should collaborate with performance staffs to limit practice reps for athletes who are accumulating dangerous levels of fatigue. Veteran players and athletes returning from injury often benefit from reduced practice volume.
- **Sleep prioritization.** This cannot be overstated. Sleep is the foundation of all recovery. Teams that build schedules allowing adequate sleep — including travel schedules that minimize red-eye flights and early wake-ups — protect their athletes' performance capacity.

## Nutrition Periodization

In-season nutrition is not a static plan — it fluctuates across the training week in response to the varying metabolic demands of practice, lifting, and game day.

### High-Demand Days (Game Day, GD-4)

- **Carbohydrate intake increases** to 5-8 g/kg body weight to fuel high-intensity activity and support glycogen replenishment
- **Protein remains constant** at 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight
- **Hydration is maximized** with pre-loading strategies (consuming 500 mL of fluid with electrolytes 2-3 hours before activity)
- **Pre-game meal** consumed 3-4 hours before kickoff: moderate protein, high carbohydrate, low fat and fiber for easy digestion

### Moderate-Demand Days (GD-3, GD+2)

- **Carbohydrate intake is moderate** at 4-6 g/kg body weight
- **Protein remains constant**
- **Fat intake increases slightly** as a caloric buffer since carbohydrate intake decreases
- **Micronutrient-dense foods** are emphasized: colorful vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds

### Low-Demand Days (GD-2, GD-1, GD+1)

- **Carbohydrate intake decreases** to 3-5 g/kg body weight, as the metabolic demands are minimal
- **Protein remains constant** to support ongoing tissue repair
- **Anti-inflammatory nutrition** is prioritized: omega-3 rich fish, tart cherry juice, turmeric, and foods high in antioxidants
- **Caloric intake may decrease slightly** but should not drop aggressively — the body is still recovering and preparing

### Supplementation During the Season

Evidence-based supplements that may support in-season performance and recovery include:

| Supplement | Dose | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Creatine Monohydrate | 3-5 g/day | Strength maintenance, cognitive function |
| Omega-3 Fatty Acids | 2-3 g EPA+DHA/day | Anti-inflammatory, brain health |
| Vitamin D | 2,000-5,000 IU/day (based on blood levels) | Immune function, bone health, muscle function |
| Tart Cherry Extract | 480 mg/day or 8 oz juice 2x/day | Inflammation reduction, sleep quality |
| Collagen Peptides | 15-20 g/day with vitamin C | Connective tissue support |
| Caffeine | 3-6 mg/kg (game day and high-intensity training) | Alertness, performance enhancement |

All supplementation should be third-party tested (NSF Certified for Sport or Informed Sport) to ensure freedom from banned substances.

## Mental Wellness During the Season

The mental demands of a football season are enormous. The weekly cycle of preparation, performance, evaluation, and preparation again creates a relentless cognitive and emotional load. Losses compound psychological stress. Injuries trigger anxiety about job security and identity. The public nature of the sport — with media scrutiny, social media commentary, and fan expectations — adds external pressure that athletes at every level must manage.

**Mental wellness strategies for the in-season period:**

- **Routine and structure.** A consistent weekly routine — same wake time, same pre-practice meal, same warm-up sequence, same post-game recovery protocol — reduces decision fatigue and creates a sense of control in an inherently unpredictable environment.
- **Compartmentalization.** The ability to mentally separate a poor performance or a tough loss from the preparation for the next game is a defining characteristic of elite competitors. Coaches and sports psychologists teach athletes to "flush" a game — positive or negative — within 24 hours and redirect mental energy toward the next opponent.
- **Social connection.** Maintaining relationships outside of football — with family, friends, and community — provides psychological resilience. Athletes who define their identity solely through football are more vulnerable to the emotional volatility of wins, losses, and playing-time decisions.
- **Professional support.** Access to sports psychologists, counselors, and mental health professionals should be normalized and encouraged at every level. The stigma around mental health support in football has diminished considerably, but many athletes — particularly at the high school level — still lack access to these resources.
- **Mindfulness and breath work.** Brief daily mindfulness practices (5-10 minutes) and controlled breathing techniques have been shown to reduce anxiety, improve focus, and enhance emotional regulation. These practices are particularly valuable on game day, when arousal levels can exceed optimal ranges.

## Bye Week Training

The bye week is a strategic recovery and development opportunity embedded within the season. How it is utilized can influence the trajectory of the second half of the campaign.

### The Standard Bye Week Approach

**Days 1-2 (immediately after the pre-bye game):** Complete rest. No lifting, no structured conditioning, no football-related activity. This is the longest uninterrupted recovery window the athlete will experience during the season, and it should be protected. Athletes are encouraged to sleep, eat well, and engage in low-intensity recreational activity.

**Day 3:** Light active recovery — 20-30 minutes of low-intensity movement (walking, cycling, swimming) and a mobility or yoga session. This session reintroduces structured movement after the rest period.

**Day 4:** Moderate training session. This is the only session during the bye week where training intensity approaches in-season norms. The athlete performs primary compound movements at moderate intensity (75-82 percent) for moderate volume (3 sets of 4-5 reps), followed by accessory work targeting individual weaknesses or injury-prone areas.

**Day 5:** Position-specific skill work and film study. The athlete refines technical elements that have been neglected during the weekly grind of game preparation.

**Days 6-7:** Transition back to the standard GD-minus weekly structure as the team begins preparation for the next opponent.

### Bye Week Considerations at Each Level

**High school:** Many high school schedules include one or two open dates. These weeks should include one moderate lifting session and one conditioning session, with the remainder dedicated to rest and recovery. For teams in playoff contention, the bye week is an opportunity to address nagging injuries and refresh fatigued athletes.

**College:** NCAA regulations apply during bye weeks just as they do during the competitive season. The eight-hour CARA limit remains in effect, and coaches must balance the desire to use the extra time for physical development against the need for genuine recovery.

**NFL:** Bye weeks in the NFL are often used for travel. Players may fly to their off-season training hub to work with a private trainer or simply take the time to rest at home with family. Teams vary in how much structure they impose during the bye — some hold a Thursday practice before releasing players; others give the full week off. The most effective approach depends on the team's record, health status, and schedule position.

## The Long Game: Season-Long Periodization

Effective in-season training is not just about managing individual weeks — it is about managing the entire 12-to-20-week season as a single periodized block.

**Early season (Weeks 1-4):** Training intensity and volume can be slightly higher because the athlete is freshest. This is the window where residual off-season gains can be maintained most effectively.

**Mid-season (Weeks 5-8):** Fatigue begins to accumulate. Training volume should decrease by an additional 10-15 percent relative to the early season. Recovery protocols become more aggressive.

**Late season (Weeks 9-12+):** The athlete is operating on accumulated fatigue, and the training program must reflect that reality. Volume is at its lowest point. Intensity remains present but is auto-regulated based on readiness markers. Recovery becomes the single highest priority.

**Playoff / postseason:** For teams that advance, training continues at the late-season minimal level. The emphasis shifts entirely to maintaining readiness and managing the physical toll of additional high-stakes games. Strength coaches during playoff runs focus on keeping athletes healthy and available, not on building new physical capacities.

## Conclusion

In-season training is the thread that ties months of off-season preparation to on-field production. Without it, the physical foundation erodes, performance declines, and injury risk climbs. With it — structured intelligently within the GD-minus framework, calibrated to the demands of each level, and integrated with comprehensive recovery and nutrition protocols — the athlete maintains the strength, power, and resilience needed to perform at the highest level from the opening kickoff to the final play of the season.

The weight room does not close when the season opens. It simply operates with greater precision, greater purpose, and a singular focus on sustaining the machine that the off-season built.
