# College Off-Season Training Program

The transition from high school to college football represents one of the most dramatic physical escalations in all of sport. Athletes who were dominant at the prep level often find themselves outmatched by the size, speed, and training sophistication of collegiate competition. The college off-season is where that gap closes — or widens. Under the guidance of full-time strength and conditioning staffs, sports dietitians, and sport science departments, college football players engage in off-season programming that is more structured, more demanding, and more closely monitored than anything they experienced in high school.

However, college off-season training does not exist in a vacuum. The NCAA imposes strict regulations on how much time coaches can require of athletes outside the competitive season. Understanding those rules — and building elite programming within their constraints — is the challenge that defines college strength and conditioning.

## The NCAA Regulatory Framework: CARA Hours

All off-season training at the NCAA Division I level operates within the framework of Countable Athletically Related Activities, known as CARA hours. These regulations dictate when coaches can require athletes to participate in training activities and for how long.

**Key CARA regulations for the off-season:**

- During the off-season (defined as outside the declared playing season and spring practice period), athletes are limited to **eight hours per week** of countable athletically related activities, with no more than **two hours per day**.
- Required weight training and conditioning sessions count toward the eight-hour weekly limit.
- "Voluntary" workouts — those that are truly optional, not monitored by coaching staff, and carry no consequences for non-attendance — do not count toward CARA hours.
- During the summer, workouts are considered voluntary as long as coaches are not present, not directing the activity, and attendance is not recorded or used in any evaluative capacity.
- Spring football practice is governed by separate rules: a maximum of 15 practice sessions over a minimum of 34 calendar days, with no more than one practice per day except for one permissible two-a-day session.

The practical implication is that college strength coaches must design programs that maximize adaptation within tightly constrained training windows. Every minute in the weight room must be purposeful, every conditioning session must be efficient, and every recovery modality must be optimized.

## The College Off-Season Timeline

The college football off-season unfolds across three distinct periods, each with its own training emphasis and regulatory framework.

### Winter Conditioning (January - March)

Winter conditioning begins shortly after the conclusion of bowl season and extends through the early weeks of spring. For teams whose seasons ended in November or early December, this period may begin in January. For teams that played deep into the College Football Playoff, training may not commence until late January or February.

**Phase 1: Post-Season Recovery and General Preparation (Weeks 1-3)**

The initial weeks prioritize physical and mental recovery. Athletes returning from a full season carry accumulated fatigue, minor soft-tissue injuries, and in many cases, the psychological weight of a long competitive campaign. Programming during this window emphasizes:

- Movement quality restoration through mobility work, corrective exercise, and light resistance training
- Aerobic base rebuilding through tempo runs, pool work, and low-intensity cycling
- Body composition assessment and individualized nutrition planning
- Mental health check-ins and goal-setting sessions with performance staff

**Phase 2: Hypertrophy and Work Capacity (Weeks 4-8)**

Once the recovery window closes, training shifts toward building lean mass and expanding work capacity. College athletes train four days per week during this phase, typically following an upper/lower split or a push/pull/legs rotation.

Training parameters during the hypertrophy phase:

| Variable | Target |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 4 sessions/week |
| Intensity | 65-75% of training max |
| Volume | 4-5 sets of 8-12 reps (compounds), 3 sets of 12-15 (accessories) |
| Rest Periods | 60-90 seconds |
| Conditioning | 2-3 sessions/week, mixed modality |

Conditioning during winter months often takes place indoors due to weather constraints. Prowler pushes, assault bike intervals, rowing ergometer work, and indoor shuttle runs are staples. Heart rate monitoring is increasingly common, allowing coaches to prescribe conditioning based on individualized heart rate zones rather than arbitrary time standards.

**Phase 3: Strength Emphasis (Weeks 9-12)**

As spring practice approaches, the training focus shifts to maximal strength development. This phase prepares athletes to withstand the physical demands of full-pad practice while continuing to build the force production capacity that drives on-field performance.

Training parameters during the strength phase:

| Variable | Target |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 4 sessions/week |
| Intensity | 80-90% of training max |
| Volume | 4-5 sets of 3-5 reps (primary), 3-4 sets of 6-8 (secondary) |
| Rest Periods | 2-4 minutes (primary lifts) |
| Conditioning | 2 sessions/week, high-intensity intervals |

A sample strength-phase training week might look like this:

| Day | Focus | Key Movements |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | Lower Body - Squat | Back Squat, Bulgarian Split Squat, GHR, Weighted Plank |
| Tuesday | Upper Body - Press | Bench Press, DB Incline, Weighted Dip, Face Pull |
| Thursday | Lower Body - Hinge | Trap Bar Deadlift, RDL, Step-Up, Sled Push |
| Friday | Upper Body - Pull | Weighted Pull-Up, Barbell Row, DB Shoulder Press, Bicep/Tricep |

### Spring Ball Preparation and Execution (March - April)

Spring practice is the competitive proving ground of the off-season. Roster spots, depth chart positions, and scholarship renewals can all be influenced by spring performance. Training during this period must support the athlete's ability to practice at a high level without accumulating excessive fatigue.

**Training adjustments during spring practice:**

- Lifting frequency drops to two or three sessions per week
- Volume decreases by 30-40 percent relative to the winter strength phase
- Intensity remains moderate to high (75-85 percent) to preserve strength
- Sessions are scheduled around practice to minimize interference — typically lifting on non-practice days or in the morning before an afternoon practice
- Conditioning is largely replaced by practice itself, which generates significant metabolic demand
- Recovery modalities (cold water immersion, compression therapy, manual therapy) are utilized aggressively

The strength staff works in close coordination with the athletic training staff during spring ball. Monitoring tools such as force plates, GPS units, and wellness questionnaires help identify athletes who are approaching overreaching states and need modified training or additional recovery.

### Summer Voluntary Workouts (May - July)

Summer training is technically voluntary under NCAA rules, but the reality is that virtually every scholarship athlete remains on campus and trains. The summer period is the longest uninterrupted training window in the college calendar and represents the greatest opportunity for physical transformation.

**Summer training is typically divided into two blocks:**

**Block 1: Accumulation (May - Mid-June)**
- High-volume training with moderate intensity
- Four to five lifting sessions per week
- Emphasis on hypertrophy for athletes who need to gain mass, and body recomposition for those who need to lean out
- Position-specific skill development sessions (quarterback throwing, receiver route work, defensive back coverage drills)
- Two to three conditioning sessions per week, progressing from general fitness to football-specific intervals

**Block 2: Intensification and Pre-Camp Preparation (Mid-June - Late July)**
- Reduced volume, increased intensity
- Strength and power emphasis with loads at 85-95 percent of training max
- Olympic lift variations and plyometric training for power development
- Conditioning transitions to camp-preparation work: repeated high-intensity intervals simulating practice demands, heat acclimatization protocols, and full-speed positional drills
- Testing week in mid-to-late July to establish benchmarks before the start of fall camp

## Strength Benchmarks by Position

College strength and conditioning staffs use position-specific benchmarks to set goals and evaluate player development. While these numbers vary by program and level of competition (FBS vs. FCS, Power conference vs. Group of Five), the following represent general targets for competitive FBS players:

### Offensive and Defensive Linemen

| Test | Target |
|---|---|
| Back Squat | 2.0-2.5x body weight |
| Bench Press | 1.5-1.8x body weight |
| Power Clean | 1.2-1.4x body weight |
| 40-Yard Dash | 4.9-5.2 seconds |
| Pro Agility | 4.5-4.8 seconds |
| Vertical Jump | 28-32 inches |
| Body Weight | 285-320 lbs |

### Linebackers and Tight Ends

| Test | Target |
|---|---|
| Back Squat | 2.0-2.3x body weight |
| Bench Press | 1.4-1.7x body weight |
| Power Clean | 1.3-1.5x body weight |
| 40-Yard Dash | 4.5-4.7 seconds |
| Pro Agility | 4.1-4.3 seconds |
| Vertical Jump | 32-36 inches |
| Body Weight | 225-255 lbs |

### Skill Positions (WR, DB, RB)

| Test | Target |
|---|---|
| Back Squat | 1.8-2.2x body weight |
| Bench Press | 1.3-1.5x body weight |
| Power Clean | 1.3-1.5x body weight |
| 40-Yard Dash | 4.3-4.6 seconds |
| Pro Agility | 3.9-4.2 seconds |
| Vertical Jump | 34-40 inches |
| Body Weight | 180-215 lbs |

These benchmarks serve as guideposts, not absolute thresholds. An athlete who falls short of a benchmark in one area may compensate with exceptional performance in another. However, significant deficits in any category typically indicate a training priority that should be addressed during the off-season.

## Nutrition and Weight Management

College football nutrition programs have become increasingly sophisticated, with most Power conference programs employing full-time sports dietitians who oversee fueling stations, post-workout nutrition, team meals, and individualized meal plans.

### Caloric Demands by Position Group

The caloric demands of college football players vary enormously based on body size, position, and training goals:

- **Offensive and defensive linemen** targeting weight gain may consume 4,500-6,000 calories per day during the off-season accumulation phase
- **Linebackers and tight ends** maintaining weight typically require 3,500-4,500 calories per day
- **Skill position players** seeking to add lean mass without excessive body fat operate in the range of 3,000-4,000 calories per day
- **Athletes seeking body recomposition** (reducing body fat while maintaining or gaining muscle) require carefully controlled caloric intake, typically 200-500 calories above maintenance with precise macronutrient distribution

### Macronutrient Guidelines

| Macronutrient | Target Range | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Protein | 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight | Muscle repair and growth |
| Carbohydrates | 4-7 g/kg body weight | Training fuel, recovery, glycogen replenishment |
| Fat | 0.8-1.2 g/kg body weight | Hormonal function, joint health, caloric density |

**Nutrient timing** becomes particularly important during the summer when athletes are training twice per day. A post-workout shake containing 30-50 grams of protein and 50-80 grams of carbohydrate consumed within 30 minutes of training completion accelerates glycogen replenishment and initiates the muscle repair process. Pre-training meals consumed 2-3 hours before training should emphasize easily digestible carbohydrates and moderate protein.

### Hydration

Hydration monitoring is standard practice at the college level. Athletes are often required to perform urine specific gravity (USG) tests before training sessions during summer months. A USG reading above 1.020 indicates dehydration and may result in the athlete being held from full participation until hydration status improves. Daily fluid intake targets of 0.5-1.0 ounce per pound of body weight serve as a baseline, with additional intake required to offset sweat losses during training.

## Position-Specific Skill Development Blocks

The college off-season provides dedicated windows for position-specific skill work that the compressed in-season schedule does not allow. While the strength and conditioning program builds the physical foundation, skill development blocks sharpen the technical tools each position requires.

**Quarterbacks:** Throwing mechanics refinement, footwork drills, film study of opposing defensive schemes, processing speed development through cognitive training tools, and chemistry-building throwing sessions with receivers.

**Offensive linemen:** Pass protection technique work, combination block timing, pull and reach-block footwork, and hand placement drills. Many programs use specialized blocking sleds and mirror drills during summer skill sessions.

**Wide receivers and tight ends:** Route-running precision, release packages against press coverage, catch-point training with ball machines, and route-concept installation with quarterbacks.

**Defensive linemen:** Pass rush move development (rip, swim, spin, bull rush), hand-fighting technique, run-fit assignments against various blocking schemes, and pursuit angle work.

**Defensive backs:** Backpedal and transition technique, press-coverage jam timing, ball-tracking and interception drills, zone coverage landmark recognition, and film study of opposing route concepts.

**Linebackers:** Drop-zone coverage technique, blitz-path execution, block-shedding drills, and tackling form refinement using controlled contact circuits.

**Special teams players:** Kickers and punters follow individualized leg-strength and flexibility programs designed in coordination with special teams coaches. Long snappers work on consistency and speed under various conditions.

## Testing and Evaluation

Formal testing occurs at multiple points throughout the college off-season, typically at the conclusion of each training phase. A comprehensive testing battery includes:

**Strength Tests:**
- Back Squat 1RM or estimated 1RM from a 3RM test
- Bench Press 1RM or estimated 1RM
- Power Clean 1RM
- Trap Bar Deadlift 1RM (at programs that use this as a primary assessment)

**Speed and Agility Tests:**
- 40-Yard Dash (electronic timing)
- Pro Agility (5-10-5)
- L-Drill (3-Cone)
- 10-Yard Split (acceleration metric)

**Power Tests:**
- Vertical Jump (standing and approach)
- Broad Jump
- Seated Medicine Ball Throw (upper body power)

**Body Composition:**
- DEXA scan (gold standard, available at most Power conference programs)
- Bod Pod (air displacement plethysmography)
- Skinfold measurements (less accurate but widely available)

**Advanced Metrics (available at well-funded programs):**
- Force plate assessments (peak force, rate of force development, asymmetry indices)
- GPS load monitoring data from training sessions
- Bar velocity tracking on primary lifts using linear position transducers

Testing results are compiled into individual athlete reports that track progress across the off-season. These reports inform training modifications, position coach evaluations, and in some cases, scholarship decisions. Athletes who demonstrate significant improvement in testing metrics between January and August position themselves favorably in fall camp depth chart battles.

## The Competitive Reality

The college off-season is not merely a physical development period — it is a competition in its own right. Every training session is observed by strength coaches who report back to the head coach and coordinators. Every testing number is recorded and compared against teammates, conference rivals, and NFL draft benchmarks. Every meal choice, every recovery session, every hour of sleep either contributes to or detracts from the athlete's trajectory.

The athletes who thrive in this environment are those who internalize a professional approach long before they reach the professional level. The college off-season teaches discipline, time management, and self-accountability in ways that extend far beyond the weight room. It is, in many ways, the crucible that separates those who will play on Sundays from those whose football careers end at commencement.

For the incoming freshman, the message is straightforward: arrive in January prepared to train harder and more consistently than at any previous point in life. For the returning veteran, the charge is equally clear: demonstrate through daily action that the off-season is not something to survive, but something to dominate. The results will be measured not only in pounds lifted and times recorded, but in the wins and losses that define the season ahead.
