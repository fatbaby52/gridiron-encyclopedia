# High School Off-Season Training Program

The off-season represents the single greatest opportunity a high school football player has to reshape a career trajectory. Between the final whistle of the last game and the opening day of summer camp, athletes who commit to structured, progressive training separate themselves from those who coast on talent alone. A well-designed high school off-season program accounts for the unique demands of adolescent development, the realities of multi-sport participation, and the progressive complexity required to build a foundation that carries through an entire career.

This guide lays out a complete 12-to-16-week off-season framework built on four distinct training phases. It addresses programming for younger athletes who are new to the weight room, offers sample weekly schedules for team-based training environments, and provides the principles that high school strength and conditioning coaches rely on to develop stronger, faster, and more resilient football players.

## The Phased Approach: Why Periodization Matters

Periodization is the systematic planning of training into distinct blocks, each with a specific physiological objective. For high school athletes, a linear or block periodization model works best because it is simple to follow, easy to coach in large groups, and produces reliable results for training ages ranging from beginners to intermediate lifters.

A standard 16-week off-season breaks down into four phases:

- **Phase 1 — General Physical Preparation (Weeks 1-4)**
- **Phase 2 — Hypertrophy (Weeks 5-8)**
- **Phase 3 — Strength (Weeks 9-12)**
- **Phase 4 — Power and Pre-Season Transition (Weeks 13-16)**

Each phase builds on the adaptations created in the previous block. Skipping phases or jumping directly to heavy strength work without the preparatory foundation dramatically increases injury risk and limits long-term development.

### Phase 1: General Physical Preparation (Weeks 1-4)

The general preparation phase re-establishes movement quality, baseline conditioning, and training discipline after the post-season break. For many high school athletes, this phase begins in January or February, depending on the state playoff calendar.

**Primary objectives:**
- Restore range of motion lost during the season
- Rebuild aerobic conditioning that deteriorated during the post-season layoff
- Teach or re-teach fundamental movement patterns (squat, hinge, press, pull, carry)
- Establish consistent attendance and training habits

During this phase, the athlete performs three full-body training sessions per week. Each session begins with a thorough dynamic warm-up lasting 10-15 minutes that includes hip mobility work, thoracic spine rotation, ankle mobility drills, and activation exercises for the glutes and scapular stabilizers.

Resistance training during general preparation uses moderate loads — typically 55-65 percent of an estimated one-rep max for athletes who have training history, or bodyweight-only movements for younger athletes entering the weight room for the first time. Sets of 10-15 repetitions are standard. The emphasis falls entirely on movement quality rather than load.

**Sample Phase 1 Training Day:**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Intensity |
|---|---|---|
| Goblet Squat | 3 x 12 | Moderate |
| DB Romanian Deadlift | 3 x 12 | Moderate |
| Push-Up Variations | 3 x 15 | Bodyweight |
| TRX/Ring Row | 3 x 12 | Bodyweight |
| Farmer's Carry | 3 x 40 yds | Moderate |
| Plank Variations | 3 x 30 sec | Bodyweight |

Conditioning during this phase consists of tempo runs (100-200 yards at 60-70 percent effort with controlled rest intervals), general movement circuits, and low-intensity shuttle work. The goal is building an aerobic base, not maximal sprint output.

### Phase 2: Hypertrophy (Weeks 5-8)

The hypertrophy phase increases training volume to stimulate muscle growth, add functional mass, and prepare connective tissues for the heavier loads that follow. This is the phase where underweight freshmen and sophomores begin to add the size they need to compete at the varsity level.

**Primary objectives:**
- Increase lean body mass through higher training volume
- Build muscular endurance that supports later strength work
- Develop work capacity and mental toughness through demanding sessions
- Progress from bodyweight and dumbbell work to barbell movements

Training frequency increases to four sessions per week, typically following an upper/lower split. Rep ranges sit between 8 and 12 for compound movements and 10 and 15 for accessory work. Rest periods shorten to 60-90 seconds between sets to maintain metabolic stress.

**Sample Upper Body Day (Hypertrophy Phase):**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest |
|---|---|---|
| Bench Press | 4 x 10 | 90 sec |
| Barbell Row | 4 x 10 | 90 sec |
| DB Incline Press | 3 x 12 | 60 sec |
| Lat Pulldown | 3 x 12 | 60 sec |
| Face Pulls | 3 x 15 | 60 sec |
| DB Curl / Tricep Pushdown | 3 x 12 each | 60 sec |

**Sample Lower Body Day (Hypertrophy Phase):**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest |
|---|---|---|
| Back Squat | 4 x 10 | 90 sec |
| RDL | 4 x 10 | 90 sec |
| Walking Lunge | 3 x 12/leg | 60 sec |
| Leg Curl | 3 x 12 | 60 sec |
| Calf Raise | 3 x 15 | 60 sec |
| Weighted Plank | 3 x 40 sec | 60 sec |

Conditioning transitions to interval work: repeated 200-meter runs at 75-80 percent effort, sled pushes, and positional conditioning circuits that begin to mimic the energy system demands of football.

### Phase 3: Strength (Weeks 9-12)

The strength phase is the centerpiece of the off-season. Loads increase significantly, volume decreases, and rest periods lengthen to allow full recovery between heavy sets. This is where athletes build the maximal force production that underpins every explosive movement on the football field.

**Primary objectives:**
- Develop maximal strength in the primary compound lifts
- Build neuromuscular efficiency and rate coding
- Establish training maxes that will guide summer programming
- Develop mental confidence under heavy loads

Training remains at four sessions per week but shifts to a primary-movement focus. Each session is organized around one or two major barbell lifts performed for 3-5 sets of 3-5 repetitions at 80-90 percent of the training max. Accessory work drops to two or three exercises per session at moderate intensity.

**Sample Strength Phase Weekly Structure:**

| Day | Primary Lift | Secondary Lift | Accessories |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monday | Back Squat 5x3 @85% | Front Squat 3x5 @70% | GHR, Ab Wheel |
| Tuesday | Bench Press 5x3 @85% | Weighted Pull-Up 4x5 | DB Row, Face Pull |
| Thursday | Deadlift 5x3 @85% | RDL 3x5 @70% | Step-Up, Pallof Press |
| Friday | Overhead Press 5x3 @85% | Incline DB Press 3x8 | Chin-Up, Tricep Work |

Conditioning during the strength phase becomes more football-specific: short sprints (10-40 yards), change-of-direction drills, and position-specific movement patterns. Volume is kept low to avoid interfering with strength adaptations.

### Phase 4: Power and Pre-Season Transition (Weeks 13-16)

The power phase converts the strength built in Phase 3 into explosive, high-velocity output. This phase bridges the gap between the weight room and the football field and typically aligns with the start of summer 7-on-7 competition.

**Primary objectives:**
- Develop rate of force development and explosive power
- Introduce or progress Olympic lift variations
- Peak speed and agility performance
- Transition training focus toward football-specific movement

Training frequency may drop to three or four sessions per week as on-field work increases. Olympic lift variations (hang clean, power clean, hang snatch) are performed for 3-5 sets of 2-3 repetitions at 70-80 percent, with full rest between sets. Plyometric training — box jumps, depth jumps, broad jumps, and bounding — supplements the lifting program.

**Sample Power Phase Training Day:**

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hang Clean | 5 x 3 | Explosive, full rest |
| Box Squat | 4 x 3 @75% | Controlled eccentric, explosive concentric |
| Box Jump | 4 x 3 | Max effort, full recovery |
| Banded Bench Press | 4 x 3 | Accommodating resistance |
| Weighted Broad Jump | 3 x 3 | Light load, max distance |
| Med Ball Slam | 3 x 5 | Max velocity |

## Bodyweight Foundations for Younger Players

Freshmen and first-time lifters — particularly athletes aged 13 and 14 — require a modified approach before entering the standard four-phase model. The priority for these athletes is mastering bodyweight movement patterns and developing the joint stability, coordination, and body awareness that make loaded training safe and productive.

A bodyweight foundation program typically runs four to eight weeks and focuses on the following competencies:

- **Squat pattern:** Bodyweight squat to depth with neutral spine, progressing to goblet squat
- **Hinge pattern:** Hip hinge with dowel, progressing to kettlebell deadlift
- **Push pattern:** Push-up with full range of motion, progressing to feet-elevated push-up
- **Pull pattern:** Inverted row or band-assisted pull-up, progressing to bodyweight pull-up
- **Carry pattern:** Farmer's carry with dumbbells, progressing to heavier loads and offset variations
- **Core stability:** Front plank, side plank, dead bug, bird dog, Pallof press

No athlete should progress to barbell movements until demonstrating competency in the corresponding bodyweight or dumbbell variation. This is not a punishment — it is the fastest path to long-term development. An athlete who spends eight weeks building a solid movement foundation will surpass a peer who loaded the barbell prematurely and developed compensatory patterns.

## Progressive Overload Principles

Progressive overload is the systematic increase of training stress over time and is the single most important principle in any strength and conditioning program. For high school athletes, overload can be applied through several variables:

- **Load:** Adding weight to the bar (the most obvious form)
- **Volume:** Adding sets or repetitions at the same weight
- **Density:** Performing the same work in less time (shorter rest periods)
- **Range of motion:** Increasing the depth or distance of a movement
- **Complexity:** Progressing from bilateral to unilateral, stable to unstable, or concentric-focused to eccentric-focused

A practical approach for high school team training is to use a simple double-progression method: the athlete performs a target rep range (for example, 3 sets of 8-10 reps) and increases the load only when the top of the rep range is achieved across all sets. If the program calls for 3 x 8-10 on the bench press and the athlete completes 3 sets of 10 with good form, the weight increases by 5 pounds the following week.

Coaches should track training loads using workout cards or digital logging systems. Athletes who cannot articulate what weight they used last week on a given exercise are not training with intent — they are exercising.

## Balancing Multi-Sport Athletes

The multi-sport athlete presents a programming challenge that requires flexibility and communication between coaching staffs. A football player who also competes in basketball, wrestling, baseball, or track and field during the winter and spring months cannot follow the same off-season training template as a football-only athlete.

**Key principles for multi-sport programming:**

1. **The in-season sport takes priority.** The football off-season program must yield to the demands of the current competitive season. A basketball player in February should not be performing max-effort squats the day before a game.

2. **Reduce volume, maintain frequency.** Multi-sport athletes should aim for two full-body lifting sessions per week during their competitive season, focusing on compound movements at moderate intensity (70-75 percent of max) for 3-4 sets of 5-6 reps. This is enough to maintain or modestly improve strength without creating excessive fatigue.

3. **Prioritize movement quality and injury prevention.** Accessory work for multi-sport athletes should focus on posterior chain strength, shoulder health, and core stability — the areas most commonly neglected by sport-specific practice.

4. **Consolidate training stress.** If a basketball player has a hard practice on Tuesday and Thursday, those are also the best days to lift — rather than spreading stress across all seven days, the athlete concentrates training stress and recovery on alternating days.

5. **Use the transition window.** When the secondary sport ends, the athlete enters the football off-season program at the phase most appropriate for the remaining time before summer camp. A wrestler whose season ends in late February may enter at Phase 1. A baseball player whose season ends in May may enter directly at Phase 3 or Phase 4.

## Team Workout Structure

High school programs typically train large groups — 40 to 100 athletes — in a single weight room session. Effective team workout structure requires organization, coaching, and accountability systems.

**Station-based training** is the most practical model for large groups. Athletes are divided into groups of three to four based on training level and position. Each group rotates through stations on a timed interval (typically 3-5 minutes per station), with a coach or trained upperclassman stationed at each major lift to monitor technique and provide feedback.

**Workout cards** are non-negotiable. Every athlete carries a card listing the day's exercises, target sets and reps, and spaces to record the loads used. This creates accountability, enables progressive overload tracking, and provides data for coaches to evaluate progress.

**The leadership model** is critical in high school settings. Senior athletes and team captains serve as station leaders, demonstrating proper technique and holding younger athletes accountable for effort and focus. This is not merely about ego — it is about creating a culture where training is taken seriously year-round.

A standard team training session lasts 60-75 minutes and follows this structure:

1. **Team warm-up (10-12 minutes):** Dynamic movement sequence performed as a group
2. **Primary movement block (20-25 minutes):** Two to three major exercises performed at assigned stations
3. **Accessory block (15-20 minutes):** Three to four supplementary exercises, typically circuit-style
4. **Conditioning finisher (8-12 minutes):** Phase-appropriate conditioning work
5. **Cool-down and mobility (5 minutes):** Static stretching and soft tissue work

## Summer 7-on-7 Preparation

The final weeks of the off-season often overlap with 7-on-7 competitions, which serve as crucial skill development opportunities for offensive and defensive players alike. Training during this period must accommodate the increased on-field workload while maintaining the strength and power gains achieved throughout the off-season.

**Programming adjustments for the 7-on-7 period:**

- Reduce lifting volume by 20-30 percent while maintaining intensity on primary lifts
- Shift conditioning emphasis from general fitness to football-specific movement: backpedaling, lateral shuffling, route running, and change-of-direction work
- Increase hydration and recovery protocols as summer heat becomes a factor
- Prioritize sleep and nutrition education, as many high school athletes neglect both during the summer months

The 7-on-7 period also provides an opportunity for coaches to evaluate the physical development that occurred during the off-season. Athletes who committed to the program will demonstrate visible improvements in speed, explosiveness, and body composition that translate directly to fall camp performance.

## Measuring Progress

A comprehensive off-season program includes testing at the beginning and end of each phase to track progress and identify areas that need additional attention. Standard high school testing metrics include:

- **Back Squat and Bench Press:** One-rep max or estimated max from a rep test
- **Power Clean:** One-rep max (for athletes trained in the movement)
- **40-Yard Dash:** Electronic timing preferred
- **Pro Agility (5-10-5):** Change-of-direction benchmark
- **Vertical Jump:** Lower-body power indicator
- **Broad Jump:** Horizontal power indicator
- **Body Composition:** Weight, and where available, body fat percentage

Testing serves a dual purpose: it provides objective data for coaching decisions, and it gives athletes concrete goals to pursue during each training phase. An athlete who knows that a 300-pound squat is the threshold for a starting position trains with a different level of intent than one who simply shows up and goes through the motions.

## The Long View

The high school off-season is not just about preparing for the next football season — it is about building habits, movement competency, and physical literacy that will serve the athlete for decades. The sophomore who learns to squat correctly, eat with purpose, and train with discipline is laying a foundation that extends far beyond the Friday night lights. Whether the destination is a college roster, a professional career, or a lifetime of health and fitness, the work starts here, in the off-season, one rep at a time.
