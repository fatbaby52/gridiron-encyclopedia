# Running Back Training & Workouts

The running back is the most physically versatile position on the football field. A complete back must possess the explosiveness to hit a hole at full speed, the vision to find cutback lanes, the hands to catch passes out of the backfield, the toughness to pick up blitzing linebackers in pass protection, and the durability to absorb hundreds of carries and collisions over a season. This guide addresses every dimension of running back development through structured, progressive training.

## Explosiveness and Power Development

Running backs win with sudden, violent bursts of acceleration. The ability to go from a standing start to top speed in two or three steps is what turns a three-yard gain into a 20-yard chunk play. Explosiveness is trained through a combination of plyometrics, Olympic lifting derivatives, and sport-specific speed work.

### Box Jumps

Box jumps develop the rate of force development in the hips, glutes, and quadriceps that drives first-step explosion. The running back begins with a box height that allows a full hip extension at the top of the jump and a soft, controlled landing. A typical progression starts at 24 inches and advances to 36 or even 42 inches over an eight-week cycle. The athlete performs three to five sets of three to five repetitions, with full recovery between sets. The emphasis is on maximum effort on each jump rather than volume. Depth jumps, where the athlete steps off a lower box, lands, and immediately explodes onto a higher box, add a reactive component that mirrors the shock absorption and re-acceleration demands of cutting in the open field.

### Power Cleans and Hang Cleans

The power clean is the gold standard for developing total-body explosiveness in running backs. The triple extension of the ankles, knees, and hips in the clean mirrors the extension pattern used when accelerating through a hole or breaking a tackle. The running back works power cleans in the three-to-five-rep range at 70 to 85 percent of one-rep max, performing four to six sets. Hang cleans, which begin from the mid-thigh rather than the floor, isolate the second pull and reduce the technical demands for athletes still developing their lifting proficiency. Trap bar jumps offer a lower-skill alternative that still targets the same explosive hip extension pattern.

### Broad Jumps and Bounding

Standing broad jumps for distance train horizontal force production, which is more specific to running back acceleration than vertical jumps alone. The athlete performs three to five maximal-effort broad jumps with full recovery, measuring distance to track progress. Bounding drills, where the athlete performs alternating single-leg jumps for distance, develop the unilateral power and coordination needed for cutting and single-leg drive through contact.

### Sled Work

Resisted sprints with a weighted sled build the strength-speed quality that running backs rely on during short-area acceleration. A sled loaded to 20 to 30 percent of the athlete's body weight provides enough resistance to overload the drive phase without distorting sprint mechanics. The running back performs six to eight sprints of 10 to 20 yards with 60 to 90 seconds of rest between reps. Heavier loads (40 to 50 percent of body weight) shift the emphasis toward pure strength and are useful during the early offseason.

## Vision Drills

Vision separates good running backs from great ones. The ability to read blocks, identify the correct lane, and make decisive cuts at full speed is a trainable skill.

### Read-and-React Cone Drills

A series of cones are set up to simulate offensive line gaps. A coach or training partner stands behind the cones and points to indicate which gap is open. The running back, starting from a simulated handoff position, must read the signal, plant, and accelerate through the designated gap. The drill progresses by reducing the time between the signal and the required cut, forcing faster processing. Eventually, the coach uses body movement rather than pointing, simulating the visual cues a running back reads from the blocking scheme.

### Film-Based Vision Training

The running back studies game film with the specific goal of identifying blocking landmarks: the playside guard's block, the fullback's lead path, the tight end's seal. The athlete pauses the film at the moment of the handoff and predicts the correct running lane before advancing the play. This exercise builds the mental framework the back uses to process information at game speed. Over time, the prediction accuracy improves, and the back begins to see the same patterns faster during live play.

### Mirror Drills

Two athletes face each other across a five-yard space. One acts as the runner, the other as the defender. The runner makes cuts and changes direction, while the defender mirrors. After five seconds, a coach signals which direction the runner should attack, and the runner explodes past the defender. This drill develops the ability to set up a defender with body language, sell a false cut, and burst in the opposite direction, all critical components of open-field vision.

## Cone Work and Agility

Agility, the ability to change direction without losing speed, is the currency of the running back position.

### 5-10-5 Short Shuttle

The pro agility shuttle measures lateral quickness and change of direction. The running back starts in a three-point stance, sprints five yards to one side, plants and sprints 10 yards to the opposite side, then plants and finishes with a five-yard sprint through the starting point. Three to five reps per session, with full recovery, build the lateral plant-and-drive mechanics used in cutback runs.

### L-Drill

The L-drill tests the ability to change direction in multiple planes. The running back sprints five yards forward, plants, shuffles five yards laterally, plants again, and sprints back to the starting point in a figure-eight pattern around three cones set in an L shape. This drill develops the multi-directional agility required to navigate traffic at the second level.

### Single-Leg Cone Hops

Single-leg cone hops build ankle stability, proprioception, and the reactive strength needed for quick, balanced cuts. The athlete hops over a line of six to eight low cones on one leg, minimizing ground contact time. Two to three sets per leg, performed as part of the warm-up, prepare the lower extremities for the high-force demands of cutting drills.

### Ladder Work

Speed ladder drills develop foot speed, coordination, and rhythm. The running back performs a variety of patterns: in-in-out-out, lateral shuffles, icky shuffles, and crossover patterns. While ladder drills do not perfectly replicate game movements, they serve as excellent neural activation tools that prime the nervous system for more sport-specific work.

## Pass Protection Techniques

The running back who cannot pass protect will not see the field on third down. Pass protection is equal parts technique and toughness.

### Stance and Alignment

In pass protection, the running back aligns with a slightly wider base than a run-blocking stance, weight balanced on the balls of the feet, hands up and ready. The inside eye of the running back locks onto the most dangerous rusher in the protection scheme, typically the linebacker or blitzing defensive back assigned to the back's gap.

### The Fit and Punch

When a rusher enters the back's gap, the athlete steps toward the rusher with a short, controlled step, initiating contact with a two-hand punch to the rusher's chest plate. The thumbs point up, the elbows lock, and the base stays wide. The goal is to absorb the rusher's momentum and anchor, not to drive block. The running back who lunges or overextends gets beaten inside or thrown aside.

### Cut Block Technique

When overmatched by a larger rusher, the running back may use a cut block to disrupt the pass rush. The athlete drives off the inside foot, aims the near shoulder at the rusher's thigh, and rolls through the block. Timing is critical: too early and the rusher steps around it, too late and the quarterback takes a hit. Cut blocks are drilled against padded dummies before progressing to live rushers.

### Blitz Pickup Recognition

The running back must scan the defensive alignment pre-snap and identify potential blitz threats. Film study and practice repetitions build the recognition needed to pick up blitzes without hesitation. Communication with the quarterback and offensive line ensures that every gap is accounted for. The running back drills blitz recognition by lining up against a simulated defense, with various players blitzing on the snap, and must correctly identify and engage the assigned threat.

## Receiving Out of the Backfield

The modern running back is a weapon in the passing game. Catching the football is a trainable skill that demands consistent, deliberate practice.

### Hand Positioning

The running back catches every ball with the hands, never trapping the ball against the body. Balls thrown above the waist are caught with thumbs together and fingers spread (diamond hands). Balls thrown below the waist are caught with pinkies together and palms up (basket catch). The athlete drills this distinction with rapid-fire tosses from a partner at varying heights.

### Route Running

Running backs run a specific route tree that differs from wide receiver routes. The flat route, angle route, wheel route, swing route, and check-down are the foundational patterns. Each route has specific landmarks, tempo changes, and break points. The running back drills these routes daily, first against air, then against a linebacker in coverage.

### Concentration Catches

The running back often catches the ball in traffic with defenders closing fast. Concentration catch drills simulate this pressure. The athlete runs a route while a coach throws tennis balls, pool noodles, or other distractions at the athlete during the catch phase. Another variation has a defender arrive at the catch point simultaneously, forcing the back to secure the ball through contact.

## Ball Security Drills

Fumbles are career killers for running backs. Ball security is not a talent but a habit that must be reinforced every single day.

### The Five Points of Contact

A properly secured football touches five points on the body: the fingertips grip the front tip, the palm presses the side panel, the forearm clamps the ball against the body, the bicep squeezes from the top, and the ball presses tightly against the rib cage. The running back checks these five points on every carry in practice, making the secure carry position automatic.

### The Gauntlet

The gauntlet drill is the most common and effective ball security exercise. The running back tucks the ball and runs through a line of teammates or coaches who swat, punch, and strip at the ball from both sides. The runner must maintain all five points of contact through repeated attacks. Variations include running through the gauntlet at full speed, at half speed while being grabbed and wrestled, and while fatigued at the end of practice.

### High-Low Drill

A coach stands in the running back's path and attacks the ball from either a high angle (punching down on the nose) or a low angle (raking up on the tail). The running back must react to the angle of attack and adjust the carry to protect the ball. Alternating between high and low attacks builds the reactive ball security that prevents fumbles on unexpected hits.

### Fatigue and Carry

The most dangerous time for ball security is late in a run when the running back is fatigued and focused on gaining extra yards rather than protecting the ball. The running back drills ball security during the final minutes of conditioning work, carrying the ball through sprints, agility drills, and up-downs. If the ball touches the ground at any point, the athlete starts the conditioning sequence over.

## Contact Balance

The ability to absorb contact, stay on the feet, and continue gaining yards after the initial hit is what separates a good running back from a dominant one.

### Heavy Bag Work

The running back runs at a heavy punching bag held by a partner, absorbs the contact, and continues driving the feet for three to five yards. The emphasis is on a low pad level at the point of contact, a forward lean, and aggressive, churning leg drive. The athlete performs six to eight reps per set, alternating the shoulder that initiates contact.

### Tackle-Break Drills

A defender wraps up the running back at various tackle points: high around the shoulders, at the waist, and low around the thighs. The running back practices specific escape techniques for each tackle point. High tackles are broken with a violent arm-over rip. Waist tackles are broken with a strong leg drive and hip twist. Low tackles require the running back to keep the feet driving and pump the knees high to break free.

### Pad Level and Leverage

Running backs who run upright absorb more punishment and generate less power through contact. The athlete drills low pad level by running through a series of blocking dummies set at chest height, forcing a natural lean. Another effective method is running on a slight uphill grade, which mechanically forces a forward lean and lower center of gravity.

### Balance Board and Stability Work

Single-leg balance work on a BOSU ball or wobble board develops the proprioception and ankle stability that help a running back maintain balance through off-center hits. The athlete performs single-leg squats, single-leg Romanian deadlifts, and catch-and-throw exercises while standing on an unstable surface. Two to three sessions per week of five to ten minutes each are sufficient.

## Strength Training Benchmarks

A strong running back is a durable running back. The following strength benchmarks provide targets for serious running back development.

### Squat

The back squat is the primary lower-body strength movement for running backs. A high school running back should target 1.5 times body weight for a single-rep max. A college-level back should reach 1.75 to 2.0 times body weight. NFL-caliber running backs often squat at or above double body weight.

### Bench Press

Upper body strength matters for pass protection, stiff arms, and breaking tackles. A bench press of 1.25 times body weight is a solid high school target, progressing to 1.5 times body weight at the college level.

### Power Clean

As discussed in the explosiveness section, the power clean directly correlates with running back performance. A one-rep max of 1.0 to 1.2 times body weight is an excellent target for high school backs, with college backs reaching 1.2 to 1.4 times body weight.

### Single-Leg Strength

Bilateral strength is important, but running backs operate on one leg at a time. Bulgarian split squats and single-leg press numbers should show no more than a 10 percent imbalance between legs. Addressing single-leg strength deficits reduces injury risk and improves cutting power.

## Periodization

The offseason (February through May) is the time to build raw strength and explosiveness. Training volume and intensity are highest during this phase, with a focus on heavy lifting, plyometrics, and speed development. The pre-season (June through August) transitions toward sport-specific conditioning, contact balance, and football skill work. In-season training (September through January) prioritizes recovery, maintenance of strength and speed, and weekly game preparation. Running backs, more than any other position, must carefully manage training load during the season to preserve freshness for game day.

## Conclusion

The complete running back is built through relentless attention to every dimension of the position: explosiveness, vision, agility, receiving, protection, ball security, and contact balance. No single trait makes a running back elite, but a deficiency in any one area will limit the athlete's potential. The training program outlined above provides a roadmap for developing every skill a running back needs, from the weight room to the film room to the practice field. Consistency, discipline, and a commitment to mastering the details are what separate the backs who play on Sundays from those who watch.
