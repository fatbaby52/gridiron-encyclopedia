# Offensive Line Training & Workouts

The offensive line is the engine room of every football team. Nothing happens on offense without five linemen working in concert to create running lanes and protect the quarterback. Unlike skill positions where individual athleticism can overcome technical flaws, offensive line play demands precise technique executed in coordination with four other players on every single snap. This guide covers the full spectrum of offensive line development, from raw strength to the nuanced footwork and communication that define elite units.

## Strength Development

Offensive linemen must be among the strongest players on the field. The ability to move defenders against their will in the run game and anchor against power rushers in pass protection depends on a foundation of maximal strength.

### Back Squat

The back squat is the cornerstone of offensive line strength training. It builds the hip and leg strength that drives every block. A high school lineman should target 1.5 times body weight for a one-rep max as a baseline, with serious competitors reaching 1.75 times body weight. College-level linemen aim for 2.0 times body weight, and professional-caliber players often squat at or above 500 pounds regardless of body weight. Squatting to parallel depth or below is non-negotiable; partial squats build partial strength that fails under the full demands of game contact.

The training cycle for squats follows a progressive overload model. During the offseason, the lineman squats three times per week: a heavy day (4 to 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps at 85 to 92 percent of max), a moderate day (4 sets of 6 to 8 reps at 72 to 80 percent), and a dynamic effort day (8 to 10 sets of 2 reps at 55 to 65 percent with maximal bar speed). Front squats supplement back squats, building the upright torso strength that translates directly to blocking posture.

### Bench Press

Upper body pressing strength determines the ability to control defenders at the point of attack. The bench press target for high school linemen is 1.25 times body weight, rising to 1.5 times body weight at the college level and 400-plus pounds at the professional level. The close-grip bench press variation develops the tricep strength used in the punch, while the floor press limits the range of motion to build lockout strength, the ability to maintain arm extension once a block is engaged.

Bench press training mirrors the squat cycle: heavy, moderate, and dynamic effort days. Dumbbell pressing variations (flat, incline, single-arm) supplement the barbell work, building shoulder stability and addressing unilateral imbalances.

### Deadlift

The deadlift develops the posterior chain strength (glutes, hamstrings, lower back) that prevents an offensive lineman from getting driven backward. Conventional deadlifts, trap bar deadlifts, and Romanian deadlifts are all valuable variations. The target one-rep max is 2.0 times body weight for a competitive college lineman. The trap bar deadlift is particularly useful for linemen because the neutral grip position and the more upright pulling posture mirror the body position used in drive blocking.

### Supplemental Strength Work

Beyond the big three lifts, offensive linemen benefit from:

**Overhead Press:** Develops the shoulder strength used in sustaining blocks at full arm extension. Target: body weight for a one-rep max.

**Barbell Row:** Builds the pulling strength that helps linemen maintain hand control on defenders. Heavy rows (4 sets of 6 to 8 reps) are a staple of every upper body session.

**Farmer's Walks:** Loaded carries build grip strength, core stability, and the full-body tension that offensive linemen maintain throughout every play. The athlete carries heavy dumbbells or farmer's walk handles for 40 to 60 yards per set, performing three to four sets.

**Neck Work:** A strong neck reduces concussion risk and helps the lineman maintain head position during contact. Four-way neck machine work, plate-loaded neck harness raises, and manual resistance exercises should be performed three to four times per week.

## Footwork

Offensive line footwork is the delivery system for strength. A lineman who can squat 600 pounds but cannot move his feet quickly and precisely will be beaten by a defender with superior technique and average strength.

### Kick Slide

The kick slide is the foundational pass protection movement. From the stance, the lineman pushes off the inside foot and slides the outside foot laterally, maintaining a shoulder-width base throughout the movement. The feet never come together, and the weight stays on the inside balls of the feet. The kick slide must be fast enough to mirror the speed rusher's outside path while staying balanced enough to anchor against a bull rush redirect.

The athlete drills kick slides against a partner who rushes from varying angles. The drill progresses from a slow, controlled pace to full-speed rushes. A common coaching tool is placing a line on the ground that the lineman cannot cross with the back foot, ensuring the depth of the set remains consistent.

### Vertical Set

The vertical set is used against speed rushers when the lineman needs maximum depth on the initial kick. Rather than sliding laterally, the lineman drops the inside foot straight back while angling the body to take away the outside rush lane. The vertical set covers ground faster than a traditional kick slide but sacrifices some lateral mobility, making it a calculated trade-off that depends on the rusher's primary move.

### Pull Technique

On designed pull plays (counter, power, trap), the offensive lineman must vacate the original position, navigate through traffic, and arrive at the target block with enough momentum and balance to execute. The pull step begins with a short opening step (six inches) in the direction of the pull, followed by an explosive crossover step to generate horizontal movement. The lineman keeps the shoulders square and the pad level low throughout the pull path. Upon reaching the target, the puller breaks down into a balanced blocking stance and drives through the block.

Pull technique is drilled daily, first against air to establish the footwork pattern, then against bags to add a contact element, and finally in team settings against live defenders. The most common error is the lineman standing up during the pull, which kills momentum and exposes the blocker to a defender's punch.

### Down Block Steps

When blocking away from the original alignment (a down block on the defender to the inside), the lineman takes a short lateral step with the playside foot, aims the playside shoulder at the defender's far hip, and drives through the block at a 45-degree angle. The footwork must be quick and precise; a slow or misdirected first step allows the defender to penetrate the gap.

### Reach Block Steps

The reach block is the opposite of the down block: the lineman must block a defender aligned to the outside. The first step is a quick lateral step with the outside foot, gaining ground toward the defender's outside shoulder. The second step is a crossover that positions the lineman's head on the playside of the defender. Reach blocks require the best lateral quickness of any run-blocking technique and are a primary focus of offseason footwork training.

## Hand Placement and Punch

The hands are the offensive lineman's primary weapon. Proper hand placement establishes control; the punch is the delivery mechanism.

### The Punch

The punch is a violent, simultaneous two-hand strike to the defender's chest plate, inside the frame of the shoulder pads. The thumbs point up, the elbows stay tight to the body, and the hands lock out at full extension upon contact. A proper punch generates enough force to jolt the defender and establish the blocker's leverage advantage.

The athlete drills the punch against a sled, against a heavy bag, and against a partner wearing a blocking shield. The emphasis is on hand speed (the punch must arrive before the defender's hands), accuracy (inside the frame), and power (full arm extension with a locked core). A common teaching tool is the two-board drill: the lineman holds a two-by-four board between the hands during the punch, ensuring the hands work together and at the correct width.

### Hand Placement

Once the punch establishes initial contact, the lineman must maintain hand placement inside the defender's frame. Hands that slip outside the frame result in holding penalties. Hands that drop below the breastplate lose leverage. The lineman drills hand replacement by having a partner repeatedly slap or pull the hands off position, forcing the blocker to reset the hands quickly and accurately.

### Independent Hand Work

Against pass rushers who use complex hand-fighting sequences, the offensive lineman must be able to operate each hand independently. One hand mirrors the rusher's outside hand while the other punches the chest plate. The athlete practices independent hand drills by engaging a partner who alternates single-hand attacks from different angles.

## Leverage Drills

Leverage, the ability to play with a low pad level while maintaining balance and power, is the most important physical concept in offensive line play. The lower lineman almost always wins at the point of attack.

### Board Drills

Two linemen face each other on a narrow board (six inches wide, eight feet long) and engage in a drive-blocking contest. The board eliminates lateral movement and forces the drill into a pure leverage battle. The lineman who plays lower and maintains a more powerful base wins. Board drills should be a weekly staple throughout the offseason.

### Chute Work

A blocking chute (a metal frame set at four to five feet high) forces the lineman to stay low during engagement. The athlete fires off the line under the chute and into a blocking sled or pad holder, maintaining low pad level throughout the contact phase. Repetitions under the chute build the muscle memory that keeps the lineman low during live play.

### Hip Flexor and Ankle Mobility

Low pad level requires sufficient hip and ankle mobility. A lineman with tight hips or limited ankle dorsiflexion will stand up under contact regardless of how much leverage is coached. Daily mobility work targeting the hip flexors (couch stretch, pigeon stretch, 90/90 rotations) and ankles (wall ankle mobilizations, banded distractions) is essential. Ten to fifteen minutes per day of dedicated mobility work pays significant dividends in a lineman's ability to sustain leverage.

## Combination Blocks

Offensive line play is not five individual battles; it is a coordinated system of combination blocks that create movement at the point of attack.

### Double Teams

The double team is the foundational combination block. Two adjacent linemen engage a single defender, drive the defender off the ball, and then one lineman releases to the second level to block a linebacker. The initial engagement requires hip-to-hip contact between the two blockers, with four hands on the defender's frame. The movement phase demands synchronized leg drive. The release point is determined by the linebacker's pursuit path: when the linebacker commits to a gap, the designated climber disengages and attacks.

Double teams are drilled daily in pairs, progressing from sled work to bag work to live repetitions. The most common error is premature release, where the climbing lineman leaves the double team before the first-level defender is driven off the ball.

### Fold Blocks

In a fold block, the playside lineman down blocks the backside defender while the backside lineman pulls around the down block to reach the playside defender. This combination creates a natural path for the ball carrier between the two blocks. The timing must be precise: the down blocker seals the defender immediately, and the fold blocker arrives at the target within one to two steps.

### Zone Combination Blocks

In zone-blocking schemes, adjacent linemen block a defined area rather than a specific defender. The covered lineman (the one with a defender directly across) secures the first-level block, while the uncovered lineman (no defender aligned directly opposite) assists on the first-level block before climbing to the second level. The uncovered lineman must read the linebacker's flow and adjust the climb angle accordingly. Zone combinations require extensive practice time to develop the feel and timing that make the scheme effective.

## Pass Protection Sets

Pass protection is the ultimate test of an offensive lineman's technique, discipline, and mental processing.

### Half-Man Principle

The fundamental rule of pass protection is that the offensive lineman is responsible for half of the defender. In a basic five-man protection against a four-man rush, each lineman is responsible for the inside half of the nearest defender. The lineman sets to take away the inside rush first, forcing the defender to take the longer outside path. This principle concentrates the protection inward, keeping the pocket tight and clean.

### Anchor Technique

When a defender converts a speed rush into a bull rush, the lineman must anchor: drop the hips, widen the base, and absorb the force without giving ground. The anchor requires tremendous core and leg strength, which is why squat and deadlift numbers matter so much for linemen. The athlete practices anchor technique against sled drives and partner bull rushes, focusing on the timing of the hip drop and the firmness of the base.

### Mirror and Redirect

Pass protection is a reactive skill. The lineman must mirror the rusher's movements and redirect to counter each move. When the rusher sets up a speed rush, the lineman kicks and slides. When the rusher converts to an inside move, the lineman redirects the hands inside and punches. When the rusher spins, the lineman opens the hips and drives through the spin. Drill work involves a partner executing a random sequence of rush moves while the lineman mirrors and responds.

## Communication

The offensive line is the only position group on the field that operates as a truly interdependent unit. Communication is the glue that holds the unit together.

### Front Identification

Before every snap, the center identifies the defensive front: the alignment of the defensive linemen and the position of the linebackers. This identification determines the blocking assignments for all five linemen. The center calls the front loudly and clearly, ensuring that every lineman hears and processes the information.

### Mike Point

The center identifies the "Mike" linebacker, the player who serves as the reference point for the protection scheme. The Mike point may not be the actual middle linebacker; it is the player around whom the protection is organized. Setting the Mike ensures that all five linemen and the running back are working from the same reference point.

### Slide and Gap Calls

In slide protection, the line shifts in one direction, with each lineman responsible for the gap to one side. The direction of the slide is communicated pre-snap based on the defensive alignment and blitz indicators. In gap protection, each lineman is responsible for a specific defender rather than a gap. The protection call determines which scheme is used and must be communicated clearly across the entire line.

### In-Play Adjustments

Communication does not end at the snap. Linemen must call out stunts, late blitzes, and defensive movement in real time. A tackle who sees an end-tackle stunt developing calls "twist" or "crash" to alert the guard. A guard who sees a delayed linebacker blitz calls "backer" to notify the center. This in-play communication is drilled in practice through stunt recognition and pickup exercises.

## Strength Benchmarks by Level

| Lift | High School | College | NFL |
|------|------------|---------|-----|
| Back Squat (1RM) | 1.5x BW | 2.0x BW | 500+ lbs |
| Bench Press (1RM) | 1.25x BW | 1.5x BW | 400+ lbs |
| Deadlift (1RM) | 1.75x BW | 2.0x BW | 550+ lbs |
| Power Clean (1RM) | 1.0x BW | 1.25x BW | 300+ lbs |
| Overhead Press (1RM) | 0.75x BW | 1.0x BW | 275+ lbs |

These benchmarks represent targets for competitive performance at each level. They are not minimums for participation but rather standards that indicate an offensive lineman possesses the raw strength necessary to compete effectively against the caliber of defensive linemen encountered at each level.

## Conclusion

Offensive line play is the ultimate team position. Individual talent matters, but the greatest offensive lines in football history were defined by cohesion, communication, and a shared commitment to technique. The training outlined above develops every physical and technical attribute an offensive lineman needs, but the most important element cannot be drilled: the willingness to sacrifice personal glory for the success of the unit. The best offensive linemen take pride in the running back's yards, the quarterback's clean jersey, and the scoreboard. Everything else is noise. The work is done in the weight room, on the practice field, and in the film room, one rep, one set, one play at a time.
