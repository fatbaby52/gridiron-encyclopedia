# Vertical Jump Training for Football

The vertical jump is one of the purest measures of lower-body explosive power available in athletic testing. At the NFL Scouting Combine, the vertical jump provides scouts and coaches with a snapshot of an athlete's ability to produce force rapidly against gravity, a quality that underpins nearly every explosive action in football: jumping for a contested catch, exploding out of a three-point stance, driving through a tackle, and changing direction at speed. Unlike many Combine drills that can be significantly improved through technical refinement alone, the vertical jump demands a genuine foundation of strength, power, and elastic energy utilization.

## The Biomechanics of the Countermovement Jump

The vertical jump performed at the Combine is a standing countermovement jump (CMJ). The athlete stands flat-footed beneath a Vertec device, reaches up with one hand to establish a standing reach height, and then jumps as high as possible to displace the highest vane. The difference between standing reach and jump reach constitutes the vertical jump measurement.

### The Countermovement

The countermovement is the rapid downward dip that precedes the upward explosion. During this phase, the athlete flexes at the hips, knees, and ankles while simultaneously loading the musculotendinous structures of the lower body. This eccentric loading phase is critical because it activates the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC), a neuromuscular mechanism that allows stored elastic energy to be released during the subsequent concentric phase.

Research has consistently shown that a countermovement jump produces 2 to 4 centimeters more height than a squat jump (where the athlete pauses at the bottom without a countermovement). This difference is entirely attributable to the elastic energy stored in the tendons and the stretch reflex activation of the muscles during the rapid countermovement.

The depth of the countermovement matters. Too shallow, and the athlete fails to adequately load the posterior chain. Too deep, and the muscles spend too long in the amortization phase (the transition from eccentric to concentric), dissipating stored elastic energy as heat. The optimal countermovement depth for most athletes places the thighs at approximately 60 to 90 degrees of knee flexion, though this varies based on individual limb lengths and strength profiles.

### The Amortization Phase

The amortization phase is the brief moment between the end of the downward countermovement and the beginning of the upward propulsion. This phase should be as short as possible, typically lasting 0.15 to 0.25 seconds in well-trained athletes. A prolonged amortization phase allows elastic energy to dissipate, reducing jump height. Athletes who appear "sticky" at the bottom of their jump, pausing noticeably before exploding upward, have a slow amortization phase and would benefit from reactive strength training.

### The Propulsive Phase

During the propulsive (concentric) phase, the athlete extends the hips, knees, and ankles in a coordinated "triple extension" pattern. The hips contribute the majority of the force, followed by the knees and then the ankles. The sequence is proximal to distal: the large, powerful gluteal muscles fire first, followed by the quadriceps, and finally the calves and foot musculature.

Peak force during the propulsive phase of an elite vertical jumper can exceed 2.5 to 3.0 times body weight. The rate at which this force is developed (rate of force development, or RFD) is arguably more important than the absolute magnitude. Two athletes may be able to produce identical peak forces, but the one who reaches that peak faster will jump higher because the propulsive phase is so brief.

## Arm Swing Technique

The arm swing is often undervalued in vertical jump preparation, yet research shows it can contribute 10 to 15 percent of total jump height. Proper arm swing technique involves:

**The Backswing**: As the athlete begins the countermovement, the arms swing backward past the hips with the elbows slightly bent. The hands reach approximately hip height behind the body. This backswing serves two purposes: it preloads the shoulder flexors for a powerful forward swing, and it assists in pulling the body downward during the countermovement, increasing the rate of eccentric loading.

**The Forward Swing**: As the athlete begins the upward propulsion, the arms drive forward and upward aggressively. The elbows extend as the hands pass face height, and the reaching arm (the one that will contact the Vertec vanes) extends fully overhead at the peak of the jump.

**Timing**: The transition from backswing to forward swing must be precisely timed to coincide with the beginning of the propulsive phase. If the arm swing is too early, its momentum is spent before the athlete leaves the ground. If too late, the arm swing occurs after peak ground reaction forces, providing no mechanical benefit.

Athletes who have neglected arm swing training can often add 1 to 3 inches to their vertical simply by practicing coordinated arm mechanics.

## The Squat-to-Jump Correlation

The relationship between lower-body maximum strength and vertical jump performance is one of the most well-documented phenomena in sports science. Studies consistently report moderate to strong correlations (r = 0.60 to 0.85) between back squat one-repetition maximum (1RM) relative to body weight and vertical jump height.

The correlation is strongest for athletes who are relatively untrained or who possess modest strength levels. For these individuals, improving squat strength from 1.0 to 1.5 times body weight produces dramatic improvements in vertical jump. However, the correlation weakens at higher strength levels. An athlete who can already squat 2.0 times body weight sees diminishing returns from additional strength work and benefits more from power and reactive strength training.

This concept is often referred to as the "strength-speed continuum." On one end sits maximal strength (heavy, slow movements). On the other sits speed-strength (light, fast movements like jumping). The vertical jump sits in the middle, requiring a blend of both qualities. The most effective training programs address the athlete's weakest link on this continuum.

A practical assessment: if an athlete's squat is below 1.5 times body weight, the priority should be building maximal strength. If the squat exceeds 2.0 times body weight but the vertical jump is underwhelming, the priority should shift to converting that strength into power through plyometrics and ballistic training.

## Depth Jumps and Reactive Strength

Depth jumps, popularized by Soviet sports scientist Yuri Verkhoshansky, are one of the most potent tools for developing vertical jump performance. The athlete steps off a box (typically 12 to 30 inches high), lands on both feet, and immediately jumps as high as possible. The goal is to minimize ground contact time while maximizing jump height after the landing.

Depth jumps develop the reactive strength index (RSI), calculated as jump height divided by ground contact time. RSI is a measure of how efficiently an athlete can utilize the stretch-shortening cycle under high eccentric loads. Football athletes with high RSI values tend to be more explosive in all directions, not just vertically.

### Depth Jump Progressions

Depth jumps are a high-intensity plyometric exercise and should be introduced only after the athlete has established a solid strength base (minimum 1.5 times body weight squat) and has progressed through lower-intensity plyometrics.

**Phase 1 - Depth Landings** (Weeks 1-2): The athlete steps off a low box (12-18 inches), lands softly, and holds the landing position for two seconds. This teaches proper landing mechanics and eccentric absorption without the added stress of an immediate rebound jump. Three sets of five repetitions.

**Phase 2 - Depth Jumps from Low Box** (Weeks 3-5): The athlete steps off a low box and immediately jumps vertically. The emphasis is on minimizing ground contact time. If the athlete cannot jump as high from the box as from a standing countermovement jump, the box is too high. Three sets of five repetitions.

**Phase 3 - Depth Jumps from Moderate Box** (Weeks 6-8): The box height increases to 18-24 inches. Volume decreases to three sets of three to four repetitions as the intensity increases.

**Phase 4 - Depth Jumps from Optimal Box** (Weeks 9+): The athlete experiments with box heights from 24 to 30 inches to find the height that produces the greatest RSI. Box heights beyond 30 inches rarely improve RSI and instead increase injury risk.

Total depth jump contacts per session should rarely exceed 25, and they should be performed only two times per week with at least 48 hours between sessions.

## Plyometric Progressions for Vertical Jump Development

Beyond depth jumps, a comprehensive plyometric program for vertical jump improvement should follow a progressive overload model:

### Low-Intensity Plyometrics
- Pogo hops (ankle-only bouncing in place)
- Line hops (side to side, front to back)
- Skipping for height
- Low box jumps (stepping down, not jumping down)

### Moderate-Intensity Plyometrics
- Countermovement jumps (repeated sets of 3-5)
- Tuck jumps
- Squat jumps (no countermovement, pause at bottom)
- Broad jump to vertical jump combinations
- Single-leg hops for distance

### High-Intensity Plyometrics
- Depth jumps (described above)
- Weighted countermovement jumps (10-20% body weight in a vest or holding dumbbells)
- Single-leg depth jumps (advanced athletes only)
- Altitude landings from increasing heights
- Repeated hurdle jumps (5 hurdles, maximum height)

The total weekly volume of ground contacts should be managed carefully. A common guideline for athletes in a Combine preparation program is 80 to 120 total ground contacts per week during the general preparation phase, decreasing to 40 to 60 contacts per week during the peaking phase.

## Broad Jump Crossover

The broad jump and vertical jump share substantial biomechanical overlap, as both require rapid triple extension and effective utilization of the stretch-shortening cycle. Athletes who train the vertical jump aggressively almost always see improvement in their broad jump performance as well.

However, the broad jump places greater emphasis on horizontal force production and the ability to project the center of mass forward at takeoff, while the vertical jump prioritizes purely vertical force. Training both movements concurrently is beneficial, but the athlete should be aware that the optimal countermovement depth and arm swing trajectory differ slightly between the two tests. The vertical jump arm swing is directed straight up, while the broad jump arm swing is directed more forward and upward at approximately 45 degrees.

## Training Protocols for Vertical Jump Improvement

### Sample 8-Week Vertical Jump Training Block

**Weeks 1-3: Strength and Foundation Phase**
- Back squat: 4 x 5 at 80-85% 1RM, twice per week
- Romanian deadlift: 3 x 8 at 70-75% 1RM
- Bulgarian split squat: 3 x 6 per leg
- Low-intensity plyometrics: 80-100 contacts per week
- Countermovement jump practice: 3 x 5 with full recovery

**Weeks 4-6: Power Conversion Phase**
- Back squat: 3 x 3 at 85-90% 1RM, twice per week
- Trap bar jump squat: 4 x 3 at 30-40% 1RM
- Depth jumps from low box: 3 x 5, twice per week
- Moderate-intensity plyometrics: 80-100 contacts per week
- Countermovement jump practice: 4 x 3 with full recovery

**Weeks 7-8: Peaking Phase**
- Back squat: 2 x 2 at 90% 1RM, once per week
- Depth jumps from optimal height: 3 x 3, once per week
- Countermovement jump practice: 5 x 2 with full recovery, twice per week
- Total plyometric contacts reduced to 40-50 per week
- Emphasis on freshness, sleep, and nutrition

### Contrast Training

Contrast training, also called post-activation potentiation (PAP) training, pairs a heavy strength exercise with a biomechanically similar explosive movement. For vertical jump development, a classic contrast pairing is:

- Heavy back squat (3 reps at 85-90% 1RM)
- Rest 2-3 minutes
- Countermovement vertical jumps (3 reps at maximum effort)

The theory is that the heavy squat activates high-threshold motor units that remain potentiated during the subsequent jump, allowing the athlete to produce more force than they would without the preceding heavy set. Research on PAP is mixed but generally supportive for well-trained athletes.

## Measurement Techniques

At the NFL Combine, the vertical jump is measured using a Vertec device. The athlete stands to the side of the Vertec, reaches up with the dominant hand (while keeping both feet flat on the ground), and displaces the highest vane possible to establish standing reach. The athlete then jumps and swipes the highest vane possible.

The athlete is typically given two to three attempts, and the best result is recorded. Standing reach is measured with the arm fully extended and the hand open, reaching as high as possible without rising onto the toes. Some athletes gain an extra half-inch by slightly shrugging the reaching shoulder upward.

During the jump, the athlete must take off and land on both feet. A one-foot takeoff is not permitted. The athlete may not take a step before jumping but is allowed a full countermovement with arm swing. The feet must remain stationary before and during the countermovement.

## Position-Specific Benchmarks

Vertical jump expectations vary significantly by position:

| Position | Elite | Good | Average | Below Average |
|----------|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| QB | > 34" | 30-34" | 26-30" | < 26" |
| RB | > 38" | 35-38" | 32-35" | < 32" |
| WR | > 40" | 37-40" | 34-37" | < 34" |
| TE | > 37" | 34-37" | 31-34" | < 31" |
| OL | > 30" | 27-30" | 24-27" | < 24" |
| DL | > 34" | 31-34" | 28-31" | < 28" |
| LB | > 38" | 35-38" | 32-35" | < 32" |
| CB | > 40" | 37-40" | 34-37" | < 34" |
| S | > 39" | 36-39" | 33-36" | < 33" |

Some of the most remarkable vertical jumps in Combine history include Gerald Sensabaugh's 46-inch effort in 2005, Chris Conley's 45-inch jump in 2015, and Byron Jones's record-setting 44.5-inch effort in 2015 (though Jones became better known for his record broad jump at the same Combine). These outlier performances demonstrate that elite vertical jumping ability, while partially genetic, can be developed to extraordinary levels through dedicated, intelligent training.

## Improving Reactive Strength Index

The reactive strength index (RSI) is calculated by dividing jump height (in meters) by ground contact time (in seconds). An RSI above 2.5 is considered excellent for football athletes, while values above 3.0 are elite.

To improve RSI, the athlete must work on both sides of the equation: increasing jump height and decreasing ground contact time. Depth jumps and drop jumps are the primary tools. The athlete should track RSI across training sessions using a jump mat or force plate if available. If RSI decreases during a training session (indicating fatigue), the athlete should stop the plyometric work for that day.

Ankle stiffness is a critical and often overlooked component of RSI. The ankle joint must behave like a stiff spring upon ground contact, transmitting force rapidly rather than absorbing it. Pogo hops, jump rope work, and calf-focused isometric holds all develop this quality.

## Recovery and Nutritional Considerations

Vertical jump performance is highly sensitive to fatigue and nutritional status. Adequate sleep (8-9 hours per night) is non-negotiable during a Combine preparation cycle. Creatine monohydrate supplementation (3-5 grams daily) has robust evidence supporting its ability to improve power output by 5 to 10 percent in trained athletes. Caffeine (3-6 mg per kilogram of body weight) taken 30 to 60 minutes before testing has also been shown to improve vertical jump performance acutely.

Hydration status directly affects neuromuscular performance. Even mild dehydration (2% body weight loss) can reduce vertical jump height by 3 to 5 percent. Athletes preparing for the Combine should monitor hydration carefully, especially if simultaneously managing body weight for weigh-in purposes.

## Conclusion

The vertical jump is a trainable quality that responds to intelligent, progressive programming. The foundation is built on maximal strength, the walls are constructed with power and ballistic training, and the roof is placed through reactive strength and technical refinement. Athletes who approach vertical jump training with the same specificity and attention to detail they bring to their sport-specific preparation will consistently outperform those who rely on natural athleticism alone. For Combine and Pro Day preparation, an 8-to-12-week focused vertical jump training block can yield improvements of 2 to 5 inches for athletes who have not previously specialized in jump training, and 1 to 2 inches for those who are already well-trained.
