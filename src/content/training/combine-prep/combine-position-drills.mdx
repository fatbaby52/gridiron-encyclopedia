# NFL Combine Position-Specific Drills

Beyond the measurables -- the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, broad jump, bench press, 3-cone drill, and shuttle run -- the NFL Scouting Combine features position-specific on-field workouts that allow scouts, coaches, and general managers to evaluate prospects in football-specific contexts. These drills simulate the movement patterns, decision-making, and skills required at each position and often carry as much evaluative weight as the standardized athletic tests. For many positions, the on-field workout is where draft stock rises or falls most dramatically, because it reveals qualities that no stopwatch or tape measure can capture: body control, hand-eye coordination, instincts, and competitive temperament.

This guide breaks down the position-specific drills for every position group, explains what evaluators are looking for, and provides preparation strategies for each.

## Quarterback Drills

The quarterback workout at the Combine is a carefully choreographed series of throws designed to evaluate accuracy, arm strength, ball placement, footwork, and the ability to throw from a variety of platforms. The drill sequence typically progresses from short, rhythm throws to deeper, more challenging routes.

### Short Accuracy Throws

The workout typically begins with quick, short-to-intermediate throws: hitches, slants, out routes, and flat routes in the 5-to-15-yard range. These throws evaluate:

**Ball Placement**: Scouts look for the quarterback's ability to place the ball on the receiver's upfield shoulder (away from the defender) consistently. On short out routes, the ball must arrive at the receiver's outside hip so the receiver can catch and turn upfield without breaking stride. On slants, the ball should lead the receiver across the middle at chest height.

**Release Quickness**: How rapidly the quarterback can get the ball out of the hand from the time the front foot hits the ground. A compact, efficient release generates velocity without excessive wind-up. Scouts look for the ball to come out "on time," meaning the throw is delivered at the break point of the receiver's route.

**Footwork in the Pocket**: Even on short throws, evaluators watch the quarterback's feet. The feet should be active and aligned toward the target. The weight transfers from the back foot to the front foot in a smooth, rhythmic motion. The base should be shoulder-width, not too narrow (which reduces power) or too wide (which reduces mobility).

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should practice short-game accuracy with a structured routine. A sample drill session includes 10 hitches, 10 slants, 10 outs, and 10 flats, each thrown to specific target windows. Using a target net or placing cones on the ground at the desired landing spots helps develop precision. Film each session and review ball placement relative to the target.

### Deep Throws

The deep-ball portion of the workout includes go routes, post routes, corner routes, and deep crossers. These throws reveal:

**Arm Strength**: The ability to drive the ball 40-plus yards with velocity and a tight spiral. Evaluators watch the trajectory of deep throws. A ball that arrives on a flat trajectory with minimal arc indicates elite arm strength. A ball that must be launched at a high arc to reach the target suggests limited velocity.

**Touch and Accuracy at Distance**: Raw arm strength is meaningless without accuracy. The deep ball must arrive in a catchable window, typically over the receiver's inside or outside shoulder depending on the route. The best deep-ball throwers can adjust their trajectory to drop the ball over the receiver's shoulder with backspin, allowing the receiver to track and catch the ball in stride.

**Weight Transfer and Hip Rotation**: Deep throws require full-body mechanics, not just arm strength. Evaluators look for a powerful push off the back foot, complete hip rotation toward the target, and a follow-through where the throwing hand finishes past the opposite hip. Quarterbacks who "arm" the deep ball without engaging the lower body reveal both a mechanical flaw and a potential ceiling on their arm strength.

**Preparation Tips**: Deep-ball accuracy is largely a function of timing and repetition. The athlete should throw deep balls at least three times per week during Combine preparation, focusing on matching the throw to the receiver's speed and route depth. Practicing with unfamiliar receivers (as will be the case at the Combine) is particularly valuable, as it forces the quarterback to calibrate timing to different speed profiles.

### On-the-Move Throws

The most revealing portion of the quarterback workout involves throws on the move: rollouts, bootlegs, throws off platform, and throws while escaping pressure. These drills evaluate:

**Accuracy While Moving**: Many quarterbacks are accurate from a clean pocket but struggle when their feet are not set. The ability to deliver accurate throws while rolling right or left, moving forward in the pocket, or sliding laterally is a distinguishing characteristic of NFL-caliber quarterbacks.

**Arm Angle Adjustability**: Throwing on the move often requires the quarterback to alter arm angle, releasing from a sidearm or three-quarter position rather than a traditional overhand release. Scouts evaluate whether the ball arrives with velocity and accuracy regardless of the release point.

**Body Control**: The quarterback's ability to maintain balance and a stable base while moving. The best quarterbacks keep their shoulders level, their eyes downfield, and their lower body quiet even when their feet are in motion.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should incorporate movement-based throwing into every practice session. Rollout drills to both sides, sprint-out throws, and throw-on-the-run ladders (where the quarterback jogs along a line and delivers throws to targets at various distances) all develop the coordination necessary for on-the-move accuracy. Emphasis should be placed on throwing to the left for right-handed quarterbacks, as this is the more unnatural movement pattern.

## Running Back Drills

Running back drills at the Combine evaluate versatility, which has become the defining requirement for the modern NFL running back. Teams want backs who can run between the tackles, catch passes out of the backfield, and protect the quarterback in blitz situations.

### Pass-Catching Drills

Running backs go through a series of pass-catching drills that include:

- Flat routes and swing passes
- Angle routes out of the backfield
- Wheel routes
- Screen passes

**What Scouts Look For**: Natural hands and the ability to catch the ball cleanly away from the body. Scouts are looking for "soft" hands that absorb the ball rather than "hard" hands that create bobbles and drops. The running back's ability to transition from catch to run is also evaluated, specifically how quickly the back can secure the ball, tuck it, and accelerate upfield after the catch.

Body positioning during the catch is critical. The back should be square to the quarterback with the eyes tracking the ball all the way into the hands. Any head-turning or body-twisting before securing the catch is a red flag.

### Blitz Pickup Drills

Blitz pickup drills simulate a pass-protection scenario where the running back must identify, engage, and sustain a block against a rushing defender (typically a linebacker). These drills evaluate:

**Recognition**: The back's ability to identify the blitzing defender quickly and position the body between the defender and the quarterback. A back who hesitates or takes a false step before engaging the rusher exposes the quarterback.

**Technique**: Proper pass-protection technique for running backs involves a wide base, a low center of gravity, active hands that strike the rusher's chest, and a balanced body position that allows the back to absorb the rusher's momentum without giving ground.

**Willingness**: Perhaps most importantly, scouts evaluate the running back's willingness to engage in pass protection. Some backs shy away from contact in blitz pickup situations, turning the shoulder or catching the rusher rather than attacking. This reluctance is a significant red flag for teams that value passing game involvement from their backs.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should practice blitz pickup against live rushers at various angles. The key is to set the feet, deliver a punch with the hands into the rusher's chest, and sustain the block for two to three seconds. Practicing against bigger, stronger rushers (linebackers or defensive ends) develops the toughness and technique required.

### Ball Security Drills

Running backs go through gauntlet-style drills where coaches and other participants attempt to strip the ball as the back runs through a line. The back must maintain five points of pressure on the ball: fingertips, palm, forearm, bicep, and chest. Scouts note how the back carries the ball (high and tight vs. loose and away from the body) and whether the back switches carrying hands when running to different sides of the field.

## Wide Receiver Drills

The wide receiver workout is one of the most watched and most consequential position workouts at the Combine. It evaluates route-running precision, hands, body control, and competitive temperament.

### The Gauntlet

The gauntlet is an iconic Combine drill where the receiver runs in a straight line while catching a series of rapidly fired passes from alternating sides. Typically, a receiver catches six to eight balls over a 40-yard distance, alternating between catches from the left and right.

**What Scouts Look For**: Hand-eye coordination, concentration, the ability to adjust the body to receive passes from different angles, and the confidence to look the ball in without flinching. A receiver who drops multiple passes in the gauntlet raises immediate concerns about reliability. The gauntlet also reveals hand mechanics: scouts want to see the ball caught with the hands, not trapped against the body.

**Preparation Tips**: The gauntlet should be practiced at least three times per week. The athlete should use two quarterbacks or jugs machines positioned on either side of a 40-yard lane, firing balls at increasing speeds. The receiver focuses on snapping the head and eyes to locate the ball as quickly as possible after each catch.

### Route-Running Drills

Receivers run a full route tree during the Combine workout, including:

- Hitch routes (5-yard stop)
- Slant routes
- Out and in routes (10-12 yards)
- Comeback routes (15-18 yards)
- Post routes
- Corner routes
- Go routes
- Double moves (hitch-and-go, out-and-up)

**What Scouts Look For**: Scouts evaluate the crispness of route breaks. Does the receiver sink the hips and snap out of the break, or does the receiver round the route with a wide, looping turn? The best route runners change direction with minimal speed loss, creating separation at the break point.

Body lean and pad level through the route are noted. Receivers who run upright throughout the route are easier for defenders to read and redirect. Receivers who vary their speed (stemming), use subtle head fakes, and lower their center of gravity before the break demonstrate the craft that separates NFL receivers from college receivers.

Scouts also evaluate how the receiver comes out of the break. The first two steps after the break point should be explosive and directed toward the target area, creating instant separation from the imaginary defender.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should film route-running sessions from both the sideline and end-zone angles to evaluate body lean, break point sharpness, and acceleration out of cuts. Practicing routes against live defensive backs in press, off, and bail coverage techniques prepares the receiver for the varied looks seen at the Combine.

### Contested Catch Drills

Some Combine workouts include contested-catch scenarios where the receiver must secure a pass while a defender (or a coach simulating a defender) applies physical contact. These drills evaluate:

**Catch Radius**: The receiver's ability to catch balls outside the frame of the body, including above the head, behind the body, and at full extension. Large catch radius is a premium trait, particularly for receivers projected to play on the outside.

**Concentration Through Contact**: The ability to secure the ball while absorbing physical contact. The receiver must keep the eyes on the ball and the hands active even as the body is being pushed, pulled, or redirected by the defender.

**Body Control**: The ability to adjust in the air, contort the body to make difficult catches, and land in bounds. High-point ability (jumping to catch the ball at its highest point) is specifically evaluated and is considered a plus trait for boundary receivers and red-zone targets.

## Offensive Line Drills

Offensive line drills at the Combine evaluate foot speed, hand technique, body control, and the ability to mirror and sustain blocks against athletic pass rushers.

### Mirror Drill

The mirror drill is the signature evaluation tool for offensive linemen. The lineman sets up in a pass-protection stance, and a coach or designated rusher executes a series of pass-rush moves: speed rush, bull rush, inside counter, spin move, and combinations. The lineman must mirror the rusher's movements laterally while maintaining proper hand placement, body position, and balance.

**What Scouts Look For**: Lateral agility, foot quickness, the ability to anchor against power, hand placement (inside the frame of the rusher's chest), and recovery ability when beaten initially. Scouts penalize linemen who cross their feet, lunge forward, or lose their base during the drill. The best offensive line prospects maintain a wide base, quick feet, and active hands throughout the drill while keeping the hips square to the line of scrimmage.

**Preparation Tips**: The mirror drill should be practiced daily during Combine preparation. The athlete should work with a training partner who executes a variety of rush moves at increasing speeds. Video analysis is essential to identify tendencies (leaning, narrowing the base, oversetting to one side) that can be corrected before the Combine.

### Kick-Slide Drill

The kick-slide drill evaluates the tackle's ability to execute a smooth, balanced pass-set (kick-slide) to the edge while maintaining depth and positioning. The athlete performs a series of kick-slides in both directions, with coaches evaluating foot speed, hip flexibility, and balance.

**What Scouts Look For**: Smooth, fluid lateral movement without crossing the feet. The inside foot should never pass the outside foot during the kick-slide. The hands should be active and ready to strike. The posture should remain upright with a slight forward lean, not hunched over or leaning backward.

### Run-Blocking Drills

Run-blocking drills include drive blocks (straight-ahead push), reach blocks (lateral movement to seal the edge), and combo blocks (working in tandem with an adjacent lineman to the second level). Scouts evaluate pad level, hand placement, leg drive, and the ability to sustain blocks through the whistle.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should practice each blocking technique against resistance (sled work, partner drills) with an emphasis on low pad level, violent hand placement, and driving the feet on contact. Film study of the specific drill sequences used in recent Combines helps the athlete prepare mentally for the flow of the workout.

## Defensive Line Drills

Defensive line drills evaluate the pass-rushing arsenal, hand technique, effort, and motor of the prospect.

### Pass Rush Drills

Defensive linemen go through a series of one-on-one pass-rush repetitions against a blocking dummy or a live offensive lineman (at some workouts). The rushes include:

- Speed rush (outside edge)
- Power rush (bull rush through the blocker)
- Inside counter (inside move after setting up outside)
- Spin move
- Dip and rip (lowering the inside shoulder and ripping through the blocker's hands)

**What Scouts Look For**: Explosiveness off the snap, hand violence (the ability to defeat the blocker's hands quickly), flexibility (the ability to bend and dip around the edge without losing speed), and a plan of attack. Scouts want to see a rusher who has a primary move and a counter move, not a one-trick pony.

The get-off, or first-step quickness off the snap, is evaluated during every repetition. A defensive lineman who consistently wins the initial half-second after the snap demonstrates the reactive quickness that translates to NFL pass-rush production.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should develop a three-move pass-rush arsenal: a primary move, a counter move, and a secondary counter. Each move should be practiced hundreds of times until it becomes instinctive. Working against a live offensive lineman at game speed is essential for developing the timing and feel that separate productive pass rushers from workout warriors.

### Block Destruction Drills

These drills evaluate the defensive lineman's ability to defeat blocks and disengage from blockers to make plays. The lineman engages a blocker (typically holding a blocking shield), uses hand techniques to control and shed the block, and then finishes by locating and "tackling" a ball carrier or moving to a designated spot.

**What Scouts Look For**: Hand speed and placement, the ability to establish leverage (getting the hands inside the blocker's frame), hip movement and flexibility, and the speed of disengagement. A defensive lineman who can control a blocker with strong hands and then shed the block quickly to make a play demonstrates the combination of power and athleticism that NFL teams covet.

## Linebacker Drills

Linebacker drills are among the most comprehensive at the Combine, reflecting the modern linebacker's need to function as a run defender, pass rusher, and coverage player.

### Coverage Drills

Coverage drills for linebackers include:

- Drop-and-break drills (dropping into a zone, reading the quarterback's eyes, and breaking on the ball)
- Man-coverage reps against running backs and tight ends
- Closing drills (reading a throw and driving to the catch point)

**What Scouts Look For**: Hip fluidity, the ability to transition from a backpedal or lateral shuffle to a forward sprint without losing speed, ball-tracking skills, and the ability to close on the ball at the catch point. Linebackers who move stiffly in coverage, with limited hip flexibility and slow transitions, are identified as potential liabilities in passing situations.

The drop-and-break drill is particularly revealing. The linebacker begins at the line of scrimmage, drops to a designated depth (typically 8-12 yards), reads a simulated quarterback, and breaks on the throw. Scouts measure the linebacker's depth of drop, the sharpness of the break, and the closing speed to the ball.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should practice drops at various depths (hook zone, curl zone, deep middle) and transitions from each depth. Working with a quarterback who gives read cues (eye movement, shoulder rotation) helps the linebacker develop the recognition skills evaluated in this drill. The athlete should film coverage reps from behind to evaluate hip position and transition mechanics.

### Tackling and Pursuit Drills

While full tackling is not permitted at the Combine, there are drills that simulate the approach and body positioning of an open-field tackle. The linebacker navigates through a series of obstacles or simulated blockers and finishes by breaking down in a tackling position on a designated ball carrier (typically a dummy or cone).

**What Scouts Look For**: The approach angle, the ability to break down from full speed to a controlled position, the body posture at the point of contact (low pad level, wide base, head up), and the overall aggression and effort displayed throughout the drill. Linebackers who coast through tackling drills or approach the contact point tentatively raise concerns about physicality and effort at the NFL level.

### Blitz Drills

Some Combine workouts include blitz drills where the linebacker rushes from an off-the-ball alignment, navigates a simulated blocker, and gets to a designated "quarterback" spot. These drills evaluate first-step quickness, the ability to defeat blocks in space, and the closing burst to the quarterback.

## Defensive Back Drills

The defensive back workout is one of the most athletic and demanding position workouts at the Combine, testing the full range of movement skills required to play cornerback or safety in the NFL.

### Backpedal Drills

The backpedal is the foundational movement for defensive backs, and Combine drills evaluate both the quality of the backpedal and the ability to transition out of it. Drills include:

- Straight backpedal for 10-15 yards
- Backpedal and flip the hips (turn and run)
- Backpedal, break forward at 45 degrees
- Backpedal, plant, and drive on the ball

**What Scouts Look For**: The quality of the backpedal itself, specifically the speed, balance, and body position. Elite defensive backs maintain a low center of gravity during the backpedal with the weight on the balls of the feet, the eyes up, and the hips sunk. The stride length should be short and quick, not long and reaching.

Equally important is the transition from the backpedal to a forward or lateral movement. The best defensive backs can flip their hips and transition to a full sprint in a single step, without a false step or a "bucket step" (a step to the side that delays the transition). This transition is the most critical skill for a defensive back and is extremely difficult to teach; scouts view a quick, fluid transition as a premium athletic trait.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should perform backpedal work daily, emphasizing depth, speed, and hip position. Transition drills should be practiced from various depths (5, 7, 10, 15 yards) and in various directions (45-degree break, 90-degree break, flip and run). A partner can provide directional cues (hand signals or ball movements) to simulate the reactive demands of game coverage.

### Break and Drive Drills

Break drills test the defensive back's ability to read a cue (usually a thrown ball or a coach's gesture), transition from the backpedal, and close on the ball. The drill typically involves:

1. Backpedal to a depth of 8-12 yards
2. Read the quarterback's (coach's) throw
3. Plant and drive on the ball at the catch point
4. Make a play on the ball (catch or deflect)

**What Scouts Look For**: The speed and efficiency of the break, specifically how quickly the defensive back can transition from retreat to attack. Scouts measure the "click and close" time, the elapsed time from the moment the back reads the throw to the moment the back arrives at the catch point. Elite defensive backs arrive at the ball before or simultaneously with the receiver, giving them the opportunity to intercept or deflect the pass.

Ball skills at the catch point are also evaluated. Can the back locate and track the ball while running? Does the back attack the ball at its highest point? Does the back use proper hand technique (high point, catch away from the body) or swat at the ball with one hand?

### Ball Skills Drills

Specific ball-skills drills may include:

- Over-the-shoulder catches while running at full speed
- Tipped-ball drills (reacting to a batted or deflected pass)
- Contested-catch situations against a receiver
- Interception technique (catching with the hands, not the body)

**What Scouts Look For**: Natural ball-hawking instincts, the ability to track the ball in the air while maintaining speed, body control and coordination at the catch point, and the competitive aggressiveness to fight for the ball against a receiver. Defensive backs who can make plays on the ball, not just defend against the catch, are valued significantly higher in the draft.

**Preparation Tips**: The athlete should catch at least 50 balls per training session during Combine preparation. Over-the-shoulder catches, diving catches, and catches while running at full speed should all be incorporated. Working with a jugs machine that launches balls at various trajectories helps develop tracking skills.

## What Scouts Look for Across All Positions

Beyond the position-specific skills evaluated in each drill, scouts are observing several universal qualities throughout the on-field workout:

**Coachability**: How does the athlete respond to instruction during the workout? Does the athlete make adjustments when a coach provides feedback between reps? Athletes who visibly improve during the workout demonstrate the coachability that coaches value in their locker room.

**Competitiveness**: The intensity and effort displayed during drills. Athletes who go through the motions at 80 percent effort are noted unfavorably compared to athletes who attack every drill at full speed with visible intensity.

**Body Language**: How the athlete carries himself between drills, after a mistake, and during downtime. Scouts look for confident, composed body language. Athletes who drop their heads after a mistake, show frustration visibly, or appear disinterested between reps raise character and maturity concerns.

**Movement Quality**: The overall fluidity, coordination, and athleticism displayed during movements. Some athletes move smoothly and effortlessly through space, while others appear stiff, mechanical, or labored. This qualitative assessment often carries as much weight as the quantitative drill results.

**Consistency**: Scouts value the athlete who performs at a high level on every repetition over the athlete who flashes brilliance on one rep and mediocrity on the next. Consistency of performance suggests reliability, preparation, and mental focus.

## Preparing for the On-Field Workout

Athletes preparing for the Combine on-field workout should follow these principles:

**Position-Specific Training**: The athlete should dedicate at least 60 percent of on-field training time to position-specific drills that will be performed at the Combine. The remaining 40 percent can be allocated to general athletic development and the standardized tests.

**Simulated Combine Sessions**: At least once per week during the final four weeks of preparation, the athlete should perform a full, timed, Combine-format on-field workout. This includes performing all drills in sequence, with the same rest intervals and coaching feedback that will occur at the actual Combine. This rehearsal reduces anxiety and builds confidence.

**Film Study of Previous Combines**: Watching film of how top prospects performed the drills in previous years provides a visual template for technique and effort level. The athlete can identify the specific drills used, the order in which they are presented, and the coaching cues given during the workout.

**Working with Unfamiliar Partners**: At the Combine, the athlete will work with unfamiliar receivers, quarterbacks, blockers, and rushers. Practicing with athletes outside the normal training group prepares the athlete for this adjustment and develops adaptability.

**Mental Preparation**: The Combine on-field workout is performed in front of hundreds of NFL scouts, coaches, general managers, and media members. The pressure is extraordinary. Mental preparation, including visualization, breathing techniques, and positive self-talk, helps the athlete perform at peak capacity under these conditions. Many top Combine preparation facilities employ sports psychologists specifically to address the mental demands of the evaluation process.

The position-specific on-field workout is the athlete's opportunity to demonstrate that the physical tools measured by the standardized tests translate into football-specific skills. An exceptional 40 time means nothing if the athlete cannot catch, block, cover, or throw when placed in a football context. Conversely, a modest 40 time can be overcome by an athlete who dominates the on-field workout with polished technique, consistent effort, and obvious football instincts. The complete Combine prospect excels at both, combining elite measurables with refined positional skills to present the total package that NFL teams are seeking.
