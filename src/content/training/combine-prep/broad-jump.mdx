# Broad Jump Training & Technique

The standing broad jump, also known as the standing long jump, is a deceptively simple test that reveals an extraordinary amount about an athlete's lower-body power, coordination, and neuromuscular efficiency. At the NFL Scouting Combine, the broad jump is measured from the starting line to the nearest point of contact upon landing, meaning that both the takeoff and the landing are critical components of the result. While the vertical jump isolates purely vertical force production, the broad jump demands the integration of horizontal and vertical forces, making it a more holistic measure of an athlete's explosive capability and one that correlates more strongly with on-field football performance.

## Why the Broad Jump Matters for Football

Football is a sport played primarily in the horizontal plane. Linemen drive opponents backward. Linebackers close gaps between themselves and ball carriers. Defensive backs break on the ball in front of them. Wide receivers explode out of their stance and attack the cushion of a defender. All of these actions require the generation and application of horizontal force.

Research has shown that broad jump distance correlates more strongly with 10-yard sprint times (r = 0.70 to 0.82) than the vertical jump does (r = 0.55 to 0.65). This makes intuitive sense: the broad jump shares a biomechanical profile with the acceleration phase of sprinting, where the body is inclined forward and force is directed primarily horizontally. NFL teams have increasingly recognized this relationship, and the broad jump has gained importance in draft evaluations over the past decade.

## Takeoff Mechanics

The broad jump begins from a stationary position with the athlete's toes behind the starting line. Unlike the vertical jump, where the athlete remains relatively upright, the broad jump requires the athlete to project the center of mass forward and upward at an optimal takeoff angle.

### Stance and Setup

The athlete stands with feet approximately hip-width to shoulder-width apart, toes pointed straight ahead or very slightly outward. The weight is distributed across the full foot with a slight bias toward the forefoot. The arms hang naturally at the sides.

Before initiating the jump, many elite broad jumpers perform a brief "rocking" motion, shifting weight slightly forward and back to prime the neuromuscular system. This is permitted at the Combine as long as the feet do not leave the ground or cross the starting line before the actual jump.

### The Countermovement

The countermovement in the broad jump is deeper and more aggressive than in the vertical jump. The athlete swings the arms backward while simultaneously flexing at the hips, knees, and ankles. The torso inclines forward more than in a vertical jump, and the hips sit back further, loading the posterior chain (glutes and hamstrings) to a greater degree.

The depth of the countermovement typically brings the thighs to approximately parallel with the ground or slightly above. Going significantly below parallel tends to slow the amortization phase without providing additional elastic energy storage.

### The Arm Swing

The arm swing in the broad jump is one of the most critical technical elements and can account for 15 to 20 percent of total distance when executed properly. The mechanics differ from the vertical jump arm swing in both trajectory and timing.

**Backswing**: The arms extend behind the body, reaching past the hips with the elbows slightly bent. The hands reach approximately the level of the gluteal fold. This position creates a significant stretch on the anterior shoulder musculature and the pectoral complex, storing elastic energy.

**Forward Swing**: As the athlete begins the propulsive phase, the arms drive forward and upward in a sweeping arc. The trajectory of the arm swing is directed at approximately 45 degrees above horizontal, which is the theoretical optimal projection angle for maximizing horizontal distance (though the actual optimal angle is slightly lower, around 40-42 degrees, due to the difference between the height of the center of mass at takeoff and landing).

**Timing**: The forward arm swing must be precisely synchronized with the triple extension of the lower body. The arms should reach their highest point (approximately face to forehead height) at the instant the feet leave the ground. If the arm swing peaks too early, the athlete "reaches" forward with the arms while the legs are still grounding, pulling the torso forward and reducing force application into the ground. If the arm swing peaks too late, its momentum cannot contribute to the takeoff.

### The Takeoff

At the moment of takeoff, the athlete should exhibit full triple extension: the hips, knees, and ankles are fully extended, with the body forming a straight line from the ankles through the hips to the shoulders. The takeoff angle of the center of mass should be approximately 40 to 45 degrees above horizontal.

The last joint to extend is the ankle, providing the final "flick" of force that adds inches to the jump. Athletes with stiff, reactive ankles (high ankle stiffness) generate more force during this final push-off phase. Athletes with poor ankle stiffness lose energy at the foot, as the ankle joint collapses slightly rather than transmitting force efficiently.

## Hip Extension Power: The Engine of the Broad Jump

The hip extensors, primarily the gluteus maximus and hamstrings, are the primary movers in the broad jump. The hip extension moment during the propulsive phase of a broad jump can exceed 300 Newton-meters in elite athletes, representing an extraordinary amount of force applied over a very short time window.

Developing hip extension power requires a multi-faceted approach:

**Maximal Strength**: The hip thrust, back squat, and deadlift all develop the capacity for peak force production in the hip extensors. For broad jump-specific development, the hip thrust is particularly valuable because it loads the glutes in a hip-dominant pattern at a joint angle that closely resembles the broad jump takeoff position.

**Explosive Strength**: Trap bar jump squats, kettlebell swings, and hang cleans develop the ability to produce force rapidly. These exercises train the neuromuscular system to recruit high-threshold motor units quickly, which is the defining characteristic of explosive power.

**Reactive Strength**: Depth jumps, bounds, and other plyometric exercises develop the stretch-shortening cycle, allowing the athlete to store and release elastic energy more efficiently during the countermovement.

## Horizontal vs. Vertical Force Production

The broad jump uniquely challenges the athlete to produce both horizontal and vertical forces simultaneously. Pure vertical force sends the athlete straight up (great for the vertical jump but poor for the broad jump). Pure horizontal force sends the athlete skidding forward with no air time. The optimal broad jump requires a precise blend of both vectors.

Training should reflect this dual demand. Exercises that emphasize horizontal force production include:

- Sled pushes and sprints
- Horizontal bounds and hops
- 45-degree back extensions and hip extensions
- Resisted broad jumps (using a light band around the waist)

Exercises that emphasize vertical force production include:

- Vertical countermovement jumps
- Squat jumps
- Depth jumps
- Barbell hip thrusts (at full extension, the force is directed vertically)

A well-designed broad jump training program includes both horizontal and vertical force exercises, with the balance shifting toward horizontal emphasis as the Combine or Pro Day approaches and technique work becomes more specific.

## Landing Technique

The landing is where many athletes lose distance unnecessarily. The Combine measures the broad jump from the starting line to the nearest point of body contact with the ground. If an athlete's heels land at 10 feet 6 inches but the athlete falls backward and touches a hand at 10 feet 2 inches, the shorter distance is recorded. This makes landing technique a critical skill.

### The Flight Phase

During the flight phase, the athlete should bring the knees toward the chest after takeoff, effectively shortening the body's moment of inertia and allowing the legs to swing forward in preparation for landing. The arms, which were overhead at takeoff, should begin to swing forward and downward during the flight.

### Foot Placement at Landing

As the athlete approaches landing, the legs extend forward with the feet reaching as far ahead as possible. The feet should be approximately hip-width apart and parallel. The heels strike the ground first, followed by the full foot.

### Absorbing the Landing

The critical moment is what happens immediately after the feet contact the ground. The athlete must drive the hips forward and the arms forward aggressively to prevent falling backward. The knees flex to absorb the impact, and the torso pitches forward over the feet. Some athletes use a technique where they immediately take a small step forward after landing to prevent backward movement, though this must be executed quickly before the measurement is taken.

A common training drill for landing technique is to practice broad jumps into a sand pit or onto a crash mat, focusing exclusively on "sticking" the landing with the weight forward over the feet. The athlete can also practice the landing mechanics separately by standing on a low box, jumping forward and slightly down, and practicing the forward weight shift upon landing.

## Training Progressions

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-3)

The initial phase focuses on building the strength foundation and introducing basic horizontal plyometrics.

**Strength Work**:
- Back squat: 4 x 5 at 80% 1RM
- Hip thrust: 4 x 6 at 75-80% 1RM
- Romanian deadlift: 3 x 8 at 70% 1RM
- Bulgarian split squat: 3 x 6 per leg

**Plyometric Work**:
- Standing broad jumps for technique (focus on arm swing and takeoff angle): 3 x 5
- Forward bounds: 3 x 4 bounds
- Single-leg hops for distance: 3 x 3 per leg
- Box jumps (low to moderate height): 3 x 5

Total ground contacts per session: 40-50

### Phase 2: Power Conversion (Weeks 4-6)

The middle phase increases the intensity of both strength and plyometric training while reducing volume.

**Strength Work**:
- Back squat: 3 x 3 at 85-90% 1RM
- Trap bar jump squat: 4 x 3 at 30-40% 1RM
- Hip thrust: 3 x 5 at 85% 1RM
- Kettlebell swing: 3 x 8 with heavy bell

**Plyometric Work**:
- Standing broad jumps (maximum effort): 4 x 3 with full recovery
- Depth jump to broad jump: 3 x 3 (step off 12-18" box, land, immediately broad jump)
- Bounding series: 3 x 5 bounds
- Weighted broad jumps (holding 10-15 lb dumbbells): 3 x 3

Total ground contacts per session: 35-45

### Phase 3: Peaking (Weeks 7-8)

The final phase reduces training stress to allow the neuromuscular system to peak while maintaining maximum-intent broad jump practice.

**Strength Work**:
- Back squat: 2 x 2 at 88-92% 1RM
- Hip thrust: 2 x 3 at 85-90% 1RM

**Plyometric Work**:
- Standing broad jumps (maximum effort, full Combine simulation): 5 x 2 with 3-4 minutes rest
- Depth drops for reactive stiffness: 3 x 3
- Light countermovement jumps as warm-up: 2 x 3

Total ground contacts per session: 20-30

### Single-Leg Progressions

Single-leg training is valuable for the broad jump because it addresses asymmetries and develops unilateral power that contributes to a more balanced, powerful bilateral takeoff. Single-leg exercises should be progressed from:

1. Single-leg box step-ups (bodyweight, then loaded)
2. Single-leg Romanian deadlifts
3. Single-leg hops for distance (in place)
4. Single-leg bounds (alternating)
5. Single-leg depth jumps (advanced athletes only)

### Weighted Broad Jumps

Performing broad jumps while holding light dumbbells (5-15 pounds per hand) or wearing a weighted vest (5-10% body weight) provides an overload stimulus that can enhance power production. The key is that the load must be light enough to preserve jump mechanics. If the athlete's technique visibly deteriorates under the load (shortened countermovement, reduced arm swing, lower takeoff angle), the weight is too heavy.

Weighted broad jumps are most effective when paired with unloaded broad jumps in a contrast training format:

- Set 1: 3 weighted broad jumps (10 lb dumbbells)
- Rest 2 minutes
- Set 2: 3 unloaded broad jumps (maximum effort)
- Rest 3 minutes
- Repeat 2-3 times

## Correlation with Football Performance

The broad jump has emerged in recent years as one of the strongest predictors of on-field football performance among Combine metrics. Studies examining NFL draft picks have found that broad jump distance correlates with:

- First-year playing time for defensive linemen
- Sack production for edge rushers
- Yards after contact for running backs
- Separation metrics for wide receivers

For offensive and defensive linemen in particular, the broad jump is considered one of the most important Combine metrics. The ability to generate horizontal force rapidly is directly applicable to blocking and pass-rushing, where the athlete must move an opponent backward or close distance to the quarterback.

## Position-Specific Benchmarks

| Position | Elite | Good | Average | Below Average |
|----------|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| QB | > 9'6" | 9'0"-9'6" | 8'4"-9'0" | < 8'4" |
| RB | > 10'6" | 10'0"-10'6" | 9'6"-10'0" | < 9'6" |
| WR | > 10'8" | 10'2"-10'8" | 9'8"-10'2" | < 9'8" |
| TE | > 10'4" | 9'10"-10'4" | 9'4"-9'10" | < 9'4" |
| OL | > 9'4" | 8'10"-9'4" | 8'2"-8'10" | < 8'2" |
| DL | > 9'10" | 9'4"-9'10" | 8'8"-9'4" | < 8'8" |
| LB | > 10'6" | 10'0"-10'6" | 9'6"-10'0" | < 9'6" |
| CB | > 10'10" | 10'4"-10'10" | 9'10"-10'4" | < 9'10" |
| S | > 10'8" | 10'2"-10'8" | 9'8"-10'2" | < 9'8" |

Byron Jones set the all-time Combine broad jump record with a leap of 12 feet 3 inches at the 2015 Combine, a performance that single-handedly elevated his draft stock from a mid-round projection to a first-round selection by the Dallas Cowboys. His record remains one of the most jaw-dropping individual performances in Combine history and illustrates how a single exceptional test result can reshape an athlete's professional trajectory.

## Common Technical Errors

**Insufficient Arm Swing**: Athletes who keep the arms close to the body or fail to generate a full-range arm swing sacrifice 6 to 12 inches of distance. The arm swing must be aggressive, coordinated, and timed precisely with the lower-body propulsion.

**Vertical Takeoff Angle**: Some athletes jump too vertically, sending the center of mass upward rather than forward. While height is necessary for air time, the takeoff angle should be approximately 40-45 degrees, not 60-70 degrees.

**Falling Backward on Landing**: The most common landing error, falling backward, can cost 6 to 18 inches. The athlete must aggressively drive the arms and hips forward upon landing. This skill must be practiced repeatedly.

**Asymmetrical Takeoff**: Pushing harder with one leg than the other causes the athlete to drift laterally during the flight phase, reducing total forward distance. Single-leg strength and plyometric work help correct this imbalance.

**Rushing the Countermovement**: An overly fast, shallow countermovement fails to adequately load the posterior chain. The countermovement should be controlled and powerful, not frantic. The athlete should "load" the hips deliberately before exploding forward.

## Integration with Overall Combine Preparation

The broad jump shares substantial training overlap with the 40-yard dash (both require horizontal force production) and the vertical jump (both require explosive triple extension). A well-designed Combine preparation program integrates training for all three events without creating excessive fatigue or overtraining specific movement patterns.

A practical approach is to organize training sessions around movement qualities rather than individual events:

- **Speed-Power Day**: 40-yard dash practice, broad jumps, sled sprints
- **Vertical Power Day**: Vertical jumps, depth jumps, heavy squats
- **Agility Day**: 3-cone drill, shuttle run, change-of-direction work
- **Strength Day**: Maximal effort lower body, hip thrusts, posterior chain

This organization ensures that the broad jump receives dedicated attention while also benefiting from the transfer effects of complementary training modalities. The athlete who approaches Combine preparation holistically, understanding how each test relates to the others, will consistently outperform the athlete who trains each event in isolation.
