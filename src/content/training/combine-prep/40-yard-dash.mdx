# 40-Yard Dash Training & Technique

The 40-yard dash remains the single most scrutinized event at the NFL Scouting Combine. While football is rarely played in a straight line over exactly 40 yards, the test has endured for decades as a proxy for an athlete's acceleration capacity, top-end speed potential, and neuromuscular efficiency. A tenth of a second can mean the difference between a first-round selection and a second-day pick, translating to millions of dollars in guaranteed money. Understanding the biomechanics, training methodology, and strategic nuances of the 40-yard dash is essential for any serious football athlete.

## Why 40 Yards?

The 40-yard distance was originally chosen because it approximates the distance a punt coverage player must sprint to reach the returner. Over time, the test became a universal benchmark applicable to every position. The distance is long enough to reveal both acceleration ability and top-end speed, yet short enough that endurance plays almost no role. For linemen, the first 10 yards matter most. For skill-position athletes, the ability to maintain velocity through 40 yards separates the elite from the merely fast.

## The Three-Point Stance: Where Everything Begins

The starting stance is arguably the most technical aspect of the entire 40-yard dash. Unlike track sprinters who use starting blocks, football athletes begin from a three-point or four-point stance on a flat surface. The stance must accomplish two objectives simultaneously: load the posterior chain for maximum force production and position the body at an optimal forward lean angle.

### Foot Placement

The athlete should position the front foot approximately one to two shoe lengths behind the starting line. The back foot sits roughly hip-width apart and staggered behind the front foot by about 12 to 18 inches, depending on the athlete's height and limb proportions. The toes of both feet should be pointed straight ahead or angled slightly inward. Excessive toe-out reduces the ability to direct force horizontally.

The front foot bears the majority of the athlete's weight. The back foot rests on the ball of the foot with the heel elevated. A common coaching cue is to imagine pressing the back foot into a wall behind the athlete, preloading the calf and Achilles tendon for the initial push.

### Hand Placement and Upper Body Position

The down hand (opposite the back foot in most cases) is placed just behind the starting line with the fingers bridged, forming an arch with the thumb and index finger. The hand should bear approximately 10 to 15 percent of the athlete's body weight. Placing too much weight forward causes the athlete to stumble on the first step. Placing too little means the stance is too upright and sacrifices forward lean.

The opposite arm is cocked back with the elbow bent at approximately 90 degrees. The shoulders should be slightly ahead of the down hand, creating a loaded, coiled position. The hips are elevated above the shoulders, typically at an angle of 45 to 50 degrees relative to the ground.

### Head and Eye Position

The athlete's eyes should focus on a point approximately three to five yards ahead on the ground. Looking up too early forces the torso upright prematurely, reducing horizontal force application during the critical drive phase. The neck stays neutral relative to the spine.

## Phase 1: First Step Explosion (0-5 Yards)

The first movement is a violent extension of the back leg combined with a powerful arm drive. The down hand lifts as the opposite arm drives forward aggressively. The first step should land approximately 12 to 18 inches in front of the starting line, directly beneath or slightly behind the athlete's center of mass.

A critical error many athletes make is overstriding on the first step. When the foot lands too far ahead of the center of mass, it acts as a brake rather than a propulsive force. The step should be short, quick, and directly into the ground at a backward angle, pushing the athlete forward like a piston.

During this phase, shin angles should be aggressive, with the tibia angled at approximately 45 degrees relative to the ground on each step. The athlete's body essentially forms a straight line from the ankle through the hip to the shoulder, resembling a sprinter coming out of blocks. Ground contact times should be long relative to top-speed sprinting because the athlete is pushing through a greater range of motion to generate horizontal force.

## Phase 2: The Drive Phase (0-10 Yards)

The drive phase encompasses the first five to seven steps. Each successive step is slightly longer than the previous one as the athlete builds velocity. The torso angle gradually rises from approximately 45 degrees to about 60 degrees by the 10-yard mark.

Key technical elements during the drive phase include:

**Arm Action**: The arms drive violently in a front-to-back motion, with the hands reaching from the hip pocket to face height. The elbows maintain roughly 90-degree angles. Arm drive is not merely cosmetic; research shows that aggressive arm action can improve sprint times by contributing to overall ground reaction forces through the stretch-shortening cycle of the trunk musculature.

**Foot Strike Pattern**: Each foot should strike the ground in a "clawing" or "pushing" motion, driving backward against the surface. The forefoot contacts first, followed by a rapid push-off. Heel contact during the drive phase is a significant technical flaw that indicates insufficient forward lean or poor ankle stiffness.

**Step Frequency and Length**: The interplay between stride frequency (how fast the legs cycle) and stride length (how far each step covers) determines velocity. During the drive phase, frequency is prioritized over length. Short, powerful steps that maintain ground contact allow for maximum horizontal force production.

## Phase 3: The Transition Phase (10-20 Yards)

The transition phase is where many athletes lose time. Between 10 and 20 yards, the athlete must smoothly shift from a forward-leaning acceleration posture to a more upright sprinting posture without losing momentum. This transition should feel gradual, not abrupt.

The torso rises from approximately 60 degrees to nearly 80 degrees relative to the ground. The athlete's gaze shifts from the ground a few yards ahead to looking toward the finish line. Step length increases while ground contact times decrease. The knees begin to lift higher with each stride as the athlete approaches top-end mechanics.

A common mistake during this phase is "popping up" too quickly. When an athlete snaps upright at the 10-yard mark, horizontal force production drops dramatically, and the athlete essentially coasts rather than continues accelerating. Elite sprinters maintain a progressive rise through this entire phase.

## Phase 4: Top-End Speed (20-40 Yards)

By the 20-yard mark, most athletes have reached 90 to 95 percent of their maximum velocity. The final 20 yards are about maintaining that speed through efficient mechanics rather than continuing to accelerate.

At top speed, the athlete should exhibit:

**High Knee Drive**: The thigh of the recovery leg reaches approximately parallel to the ground before the foot cycles back down to the track. This creates a longer lever and allows for greater ground force application.

**Dorsiflexed Ankles**: The foot should be pulled up (toes toward the shin) before ground contact. A floppy, plantarflexed ankle at contact absorbs force rather than transmitting it, acting like a wet noodle rather than a stiff spring.

**Relaxed Upper Body**: Tension in the face, neck, shoulders, and hands bleeds speed. The jaw should be loose, the shoulders down and relaxed, and the hands open or lightly cupped. Clenched fists create tension that radiates up the arm and into the shoulder girdle.

**Front-Side Mechanics**: At top speed, the emphasis shifts to "front-side mechanics," meaning the athlete focuses on driving the knees up and forward rather than pushing backward. The ground contact occurs beneath the center of mass, and the foot strikes in a quick, stiff manner with minimal ground contact time.

## Hand Timing vs. Electronic Timing

Understanding the difference between hand-timed and electronically-timed 40-yard dashes is crucial for properly evaluating results. Hand timing, still used at many Pro Days, typically produces times 0.15 to 0.24 seconds faster than electronic timing due to human reaction time on the start.

At the NFL Combine, electronic timing pads are used. The clock starts when the athlete's hand lifts from the ground (breaking contact with the pressure sensor) and stops when the athlete crosses the laser at the finish line. This system is precise to the hundredth of a second and eliminates starter bias.

When an athlete posts a "4.35 hand-timed" at a Pro Day, scouts typically add 0.08 to 0.12 seconds for a more accurate comparison to Combine electronic times. Some evaluators use a flat 0.10 adjustment, though the variance depends on the timer's experience and reflexes.

The Combine also records 10-yard and 20-yard splits, which provide granular data on an athlete's acceleration profile. A wide receiver with a 1.50-second 10-yard split but a 4.38 overall time demonstrates exceptional acceleration, which may be more relevant to route running than raw top-end speed.

## Training Protocols

### Block Start and Stance Work

Although starting blocks are not used at the Combine, practicing starts from blocks can help the athlete develop explosive hip extension patterns that transfer directly to the three-point stance. Three to five sessions per week of pure start work, with four to six repetitions per session, builds neuromuscular patterning for the first three steps.

### Resisted Sprints

Sled pushes and pulls, band-resisted sprints, and hill sprints all overload the acceleration phase. The resistance should be heavy enough to challenge the athlete but light enough to maintain sprint mechanics. A general guideline is that sled loads should not reduce the athlete's sprint speed by more than 10 to 15 percent. Loads beyond this threshold alter mechanics to the point where negative transfer occurs.

A sample resisted sprint session might include:

- 4 x 10 yards with heavy sled (30-40% body weight)
- 4 x 20 yards with moderate sled (15-25% body weight)
- 3 x 30 yards with light sled (10-15% body weight)
- 2 x 40 yards unresisted (full speed with focus on mechanics)

### Overspeed Training

Downhill running on a gentle slope (2-3 degree grade), assisted sprints using bungee cords, and high-speed treadmill running can help the athlete's nervous system learn to fire at higher frequencies. Overspeed work should be used sparingly, typically once per week, as it places significant stress on the hamstrings and connective tissue.

### Plyometric Integration

Plyometric exercises such as bounds, single-leg hops, and depth jumps develop the reactive strength and tendon stiffness necessary for efficient force transmission during sprinting. A well-designed plyometric program complements sprint training by improving the stretch-shortening cycle in the lower extremity.

### Strength Training Correlation

Maximum strength, particularly in the squat and hip thrust, has a well-documented correlation with sprint performance. Research consistently shows that athletes who can squat 1.5 to 2.0 times their body weight tend to produce faster acceleration times than weaker athletes. However, there is a point of diminishing returns; once an athlete reaches a sufficient strength base, additional strength gains provide less improvement per unit of effort compared to speed-specific training.

## Common Mistakes

**False Stepping**: Taking a small jab step backward before the first forward step is a time-killer that adds 0.05 to 0.10 seconds. This often stems from an overly upright stance or poor weight distribution.

**Arm Crossover**: When the arms swing across the midline of the body rather than front-to-back, rotational forces are created that waste energy and slow the athlete down.

**Premature Upright Posture**: Standing up too early sacrifices the horizontal force production window of the drive phase. The athlete should feel like they are "pushing the ground away" for the first 15 yards.

**Looking at the Timer**: Turning the head to glance at the finish-line timer creates asymmetrical muscle activation and can slow the athlete by hundredths of a second.

**Decelerating Before the Finish**: The athlete must sprint through the finish line, not to it. Many athletes subconsciously begin decelerating at the 38-yard mark, costing them precious hundredths.

## Position-Specific Benchmarks

Understanding what constitutes an elite, good, average, and poor 40 time varies significantly by position:

| Position | Elite | Good | Average | Below Average |
|----------|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| QB | < 4.55 | 4.55-4.70 | 4.70-4.85 | > 4.85 |
| RB | < 4.40 | 4.40-4.50 | 4.50-4.60 | > 4.60 |
| WR | < 4.35 | 4.35-4.45 | 4.45-4.55 | > 4.55 |
| TE | < 4.55 | 4.55-4.65 | 4.65-4.80 | > 4.80 |
| OL | < 4.95 | 4.95-5.15 | 5.15-5.35 | > 5.35 |
| DL | < 4.70 | 4.70-4.90 | 4.90-5.10 | > 5.10 |
| LB | < 4.50 | 4.50-4.65 | 4.65-4.80 | > 4.80 |
| CB | < 4.35 | 4.35-4.45 | 4.45-4.55 | > 4.55 |
| S | < 4.40 | 4.40-4.50 | 4.50-4.60 | > 4.60 |

## Famous Combine 40-Yard Dash Times

The 40-yard dash has produced some legendary moments at the Combine. Chris Johnson's 4.24-second run in 2008 stood as the official electronic record for years and cemented his status as a top draft pick. John Ross shattered that mark with a 4.22 in 2017, a time that still generates debate about its accuracy and the conditions under which it was recorded.

Bo Jackson reportedly ran a 4.12 at the 1986 Combine, though that time was hand-timed and likely closer to 4.25 electronically. Deion Sanders posted a 4.27 in 1989, again hand-timed. More recently, wide receivers like Henry Ruggs III (4.27 in 2020) and Tyreek Hill (4.29 at his Pro Day in 2016) have demonstrated that sub-4.30 speed translates directly to game-breaking ability at the NFL level.

Conversely, Tom Brady's infamous 5.28-second 40-yard dash at the 2000 Combine remains a reminder that straight-line speed is only one piece of the evaluation puzzle. Brady's subsequent career as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history underscores that positional context matters enormously.

## Programming Considerations for Combine Preparation

A typical 8-to-12-week Combine preparation program should periodize sprint training in three phases:

**Weeks 1-4 (General Preparation)**: The athlete focuses on building a strength base, correcting mechanical flaws, and developing general work capacity. Sprint volumes are moderate (300-500 yards per session), and intensity is submaximal (85-90%).

**Weeks 5-8 (Specific Preparation)**: Intensity increases to 95-100%, volumes decrease, and the focus shifts to full-speed 40-yard repetitions with full recovery. Resisted sprint work decreases while unresisted speed work increases. Start-specific drills become the priority.

**Weeks 9-12 (Peaking/Competition)**: Volume drops significantly. The athlete performs only two to three high-quality sprint sessions per week, emphasizing full-speed 40-yard runs from the three-point stance. Strength training shifts to a maintenance model. The nervous system is allowed to peak through reduced training stress and adequate recovery.

Rest intervals between maximal sprint efforts should be two to four minutes per 10 yards sprinted, meaning a full 40-yard repetition requires eight to twelve minutes of rest for full phosphocreatine recovery and neural restoration.

## Final Considerations

The 40-yard dash is a skill, not merely a test of raw genetic speed. While an athlete's ceiling is largely determined by muscle fiber composition and limb proportions, the gap between an athlete's current time and their potential best can often be closed by 0.10 to 0.20 seconds through dedicated technical refinement and intelligent programming. For athletes preparing for the Combine or Pro Day, investing in qualified sprint coaching, video analysis of every training session, and meticulous attention to recovery protocols can yield significant returns on one of professional football's most important evaluation tools.
