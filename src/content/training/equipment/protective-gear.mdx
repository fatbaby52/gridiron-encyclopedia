# Football Protective Gear & Equipment

Football is a collision sport, and the equipment that stands between a player and serious injury deserves as much attention and investment as any aspect of training or preparation. Protective gear in football has evolved dramatically over the past two decades, driven by advances in materials science, a deeper understanding of head trauma, and an industry-wide commitment to reducing catastrophic injuries.

This guide covers every major category of football protective equipment, from the helmet down to ankle braces, with emphasis on what to look for, how fit affects protection, and how safety standards and requirements differ across levels of play.

## Helmet Technology and Fitting

The football helmet is the single most important piece of protective equipment a player wears. It is also the most technologically advanced, the most heavily regulated, and the most consequential in terms of injury prevention.

### Major Manufacturers

Four companies dominate the football helmet market, each with a distinct approach to impact management.

**Riddell** is the longest-established name in football helmets and remains the most widely used brand at every level. The Riddell SpeedFlex, one of the most popular helmets in football, features a flexible panel in the crown that deforms on impact to redirect energy. Riddell's InSite sensor technology, built into select models, tracks head impact data that can be reviewed by athletic trainers and medical staff. The company's extensive size range and aftermarket customization options make fitting straightforward for most head shapes.

**Schutt** is Riddell's closest competitor in market share and offers a range of helmets from entry-level youth models to the professional-grade F7 series. Schutt helmets are known for their TPU (thermoplastic urethane) cushioning system, which uses columnar energy absorbers rather than traditional foam padding. The F7 features a Tektonic Plate system in the shell that allows independent movement of the shell panels, managing rotational forces. Schutt helmets tend to have a slightly different fit profile than Riddell, and some players find one brand more comfortable than the other based on head shape.

**VICIS** entered the market with a fundamentally different design philosophy. The VICIS Zero2 features a deformable outer shell -- the shell itself is designed to flex and absorb energy on impact, similar to how a car's crumple zone works. Beneath the outer shell, a columnar layer provides additional energy absorption. Independent testing has consistently rated VICIS helmets at or near the top for impact protection. The trade-off has historically been a higher price point and heavier weight compared to traditional helmets.

**Xenith** differentiates itself with its Adaptive Head Protection system, which uses air-filled shock absorbers (Shock Bonnet) that conform to the head and adjust to the magnitude of each impact. Lighter impacts compress the air cells partially, while heavier impacts cause more deformation and greater energy absorption. Xenith helmets have earned strong independent safety ratings and are popular at the college level.

### Fitting a Football Helmet

A helmet that does not fit properly cannot protect properly, regardless of its technology or price. Helmet fitting follows a systematic process.

**Circumference measurement.** Using a flexible measuring tape, measure around the widest part of the head, approximately one inch above the eyebrows. This measurement determines the starting shell size.

**Shell fit.** The helmet should sit level on the head with the front edge approximately one inch above the eyebrows. The shell should not rock side to side or front to back. If it does, the shell size is wrong -- no amount of internal padding adjustment will correct a shell that is too large or too small.

**Internal padding.** Once the correct shell size is identified, the internal pads (crown, front, rear, jaw) are adjusted or swapped to achieve a snug, even fit. Every pad should contact the head without creating pressure points. The jaw pads should press firmly against the sides of the face, and the crown pad should contact the top of the head without pushing the helmet down over the eyes.

**Chin strap.** With the chin strap fastened, the helmet should be immovable when firmly tugged in any direction. The chin strap buckles should be positioned symmetrically, and the strap should cup the chin without riding up.

**Facemask.** The facemask must be appropriate for the player's position (more bars for linemen and tight ends, fewer bars for quarterbacks and skill-position players) and must be mounted securely to the shell. The player's line of sight should be unobstructed, and there should be adequate clearance between the facemask and the face to prevent contact during impacts.

**Inflation systems.** Many helmets use air-bladder systems for fine-tuning fit. These should be inflated according to the manufacturer's specifications -- over-inflation creates pressure points, while under-inflation allows excessive helmet movement.

### Reconditioning and Replacement

Football helmets are not indefinite-use equipment. The materials that absorb impact degrade over time, even without visible damage.

**Reconditioning** is the process of inspecting, testing, and refurbishing a helmet. It includes shell integrity testing, padding replacement, hardware inspection, and recertification. NOCSAE (the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment) requires that helmets be reconditioned by a licensed facility and pass post-reconditioning certification testing.

**Replacement timelines.** Most manufacturers certify their helmets for a specific number of years from the date of manufacture (typically ten years for the shell). However, internal padding and energy-absorbing components may need replacement more frequently, especially for players who experience heavy contact. Any helmet involved in a significant impact should be inspected by a qualified professional before being returned to use.

## Shoulder Pads by Position

Shoulder pads are the second most critical piece of protective equipment. Modern shoulder pads vary significantly by position, and the days of one-size-fits-all, bulky pads are long past.

### Skill-Position Shoulder Pads

Wide receivers, defensive backs, and running backs need shoulder pads that protect the shoulders, clavicle, and upper chest without restricting arm movement or adding unnecessary weight. Skill-position pads feature narrower arch widths, lower profiles, and minimal bulk around the shoulder caps.

**Key features.** Lightweight foam or polymer padding that meets minimum protection standards without the heavy reinforcement required for line play. Extended range of motion at the shoulder joint for overhead catches and arm tackles. A close-fitting design that does not shift during sprinting or cutting.

### Lineman Shoulder Pads

Offensive and defensive linemen require the most substantial shoulder pads on the team. The shoulders absorb repeated high-force impacts from blocking and pass-rushing, and the pads must distribute these forces across a wide area.

**Key features.** Wider arch construction that covers the deltoids and extends further down the chest and back. Thicker, higher-density foam or multi-layer impact systems. Raised shoulder caps that deflect blows away from the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. Many lineman pads include built-in back plates and increased clavicle protection.

### Linebacker and Tight End Pads

These positions demand a hybrid pad that balances the coverage and protection of a lineman pad with the mobility of a skill-position pad. The result is typically a mid-weight pad with a moderate arch width, adequate shoulder cap height, and enough flexibility for players who both engage in contact at the line of scrimmage and need to drop into coverage or run routes.

### Quarterback Shoulder Pads

Quarterback pads are the lightest and most streamlined on the field. They prioritize unrestricted throwing motion above all else. The shoulder caps are minimal, the arch is narrow, and the entire unit is designed to stay out of the way of the throwing arm's range of motion. This reduced coverage comes with reduced protection -- quarterbacks accept this trade-off because their on-field role involves less direct contact than other positions.

### Fitting Shoulder Pads

Shoulder pads are sized by the distance between the bony tips of the shoulder blades (the acromion processes), measured across the back. The correct pad should sit level on the shoulders with the arch centered on the sternum, and the epaulets (shoulder caps) should cover the deltoids without hanging over the edge of the shoulder.

The bottom of the front panel should not dig into the rib cage when the arms are raised. The lacing or buckle closure on the front should be snug enough to prevent the pads from riding up during contact but not so tight that it restricts breathing.

## Rib Protectors

Rib protectors (often called rib vests or flak jackets) provide additional padding to the rib cage and midsection, areas that are particularly vulnerable to helmet-to-body impacts and direct blows during tackles.

**Who wears them.** Quarterbacks are the most common rib protector wearers because they frequently absorb hits from the blindside while their arms are extended in the throwing motion, leaving the torso exposed. Receivers crossing over the middle, running backs taking hits in the hole, and any player returning from a rib injury also commonly wear rib protection.

**Types.** Stand-alone rib vests wear under the jersey and over a base layer. Integrated systems attach directly to the shoulder pads, which simplifies the equipment stack and prevents the protector from shifting during play. Integrated options are generally more stable but limit the player's ability to remove rib protection without removing the shoulder pads.

**Padding.** Hard-shell plastic plates backed by foam provide maximum protection but feel rigid. Foam-only designs are more flexible and comfortable but offer less protection against concentrated impact forces. Some modern rib protectors use rate-sensitive materials that remain flexible during normal movement but harden on impact.

## Padded Compression Gear

The rise of padded compression garments has changed how many football players approach lower-body and torso protection. These garments integrate thin, flexible padding directly into compression shorts, shirts, and tights, replacing or supplementing the traditional hard-shell thigh and knee pads that fit into jersey pockets.

**Compression shorts with integrated padding** typically include hip, thigh, and tailbone pads. The compression fabric holds the pads in position without the shifting that occurs with pocket-style pads. The padding is usually thin enough to fit comfortably under standard football pants.

**Compression shirts with padding** protect the ribs, back, and shoulders with strategically placed foam inserts. These are popular as an alternative to bulky rib vests, though they provide less protection against high-force impacts.

**Material.** The best padded compression garments use moisture-wicking, four-way stretch fabrics that do not restrict movement. Antimicrobial treatments help control odor in garments that are worn directly against the skin during heavy exertion.

## Knee and Thigh Pads

Knee and thigh pads protect against contusions, abrasions, and direct impacts to the lower extremities. Despite their importance, they are among the most frequently neglected pieces of equipment -- many players remove them for comfort or perceived speed advantages, a practice that most coaches and medical staff strongly discourage.

### Thigh Pads

Thigh pads are required by rule at all levels of play. They fit into pockets on the inner thighs of football pants and protect the quadriceps from helmet and knee impacts. Standard-issue thigh pads are lightweight foam or hard-shell plastic with foam backing. Aftermarket options range from basic foam replacements to multi-density inserts with gel impact layers.

### Knee Pads

Knee pads protect the front and sides of the knee from ground contact, direct hits, and the abrasion that occurs during dives and slides. Like thigh pads, they fit into pant pockets. Low-profile gel or foam pads are available for players who want protection without the bulk of traditional hard-shell inserts.

### Compliance

Despite universal pad requirements, enforcement varies. At the high school level, officials may check for pad presence during pregame inspections. At the college and professional levels, pad requirements are written into the rules, and players who remove them risk penalties or fines. The NFL has increasingly enforced knee and thigh pad requirements in recent years following a period where many players had quietly abandoned them.

## Ankle Braces and Tape

Ankle injuries are among the most common in football, and ankle support is a critical element of a player's protective strategy.

### Ankle Braces

**Lace-up braces** are the most common preventive ankle support. They wrap around the foot and ankle in a figure-eight pattern, mimicking the support that athletic tape provides but with the advantage of reusability and consistency. Many lace-up braces include supplemental stirrup straps that reinforce inversion and eversion restriction.

**Rigid braces** (sometimes called ASOs or semi-rigid braces) incorporate hard plastic or metal supports on the medial and lateral sides of the ankle. They provide more stability than lace-up braces and are commonly prescribed after moderate sprains. Some players find them too restrictive for dynamic movement.

**Hybrid braces** combine a soft inner support with external rigid elements, attempting to balance protection and mobility. These are increasingly popular among players who have mild chronic ankle instability but need to maintain full range of motion for their position.

### Athletic Tape

Athletic taping by a certified athletic trainer remains the gold standard for game-day ankle support in many programs. Properly applied ankle tape restricts dangerous ranges of motion (excessive inversion and eversion) while allowing functional dorsiflexion and plantarflexion.

**Limitations.** Tape loosens over the course of a game. Studies show that tape loses a significant percentage of its restrictive properties within twenty to thirty minutes of vigorous activity. This is why many programs use a combination approach: a lace-up brace for baseline support with tape applied over the top for game-day reinforcement.

**Pre-wrap** is applied under the tape to protect the skin from the adhesive and reduce irritation. Skin preparation sprays (adherent sprays) help tape stick to pre-wrap and skin, extending its effective duration.

## Neck Rolls and Cowboy Collars

Neck protection equipment addresses one of the most vulnerable areas of the football player's anatomy.

**Neck rolls** are cylindrical foam pads that attach to the rear of the shoulder pads and wrap partially around the neck. They limit cervical extension (backward bending) by creating a physical barrier that prevents the head from being driven backward during contact. Neck rolls are less common in modern football than they were in previous decades but remain in use among linemen and linebackers who are at higher risk of extension injuries.

**Cowboy collars** (also called butterfly restrictors) are a more modern alternative that attaches to the shoulder pads and extends upward behind the head and along both sides of the neck. They restrict extension and lateral bending more effectively than traditional neck rolls while distributing their restrictive force over a broader area.

**Who should wear them.** Any player with a history of stingers (burner injuries), cervical sprains, or neck stiffness benefits from neck protection. Linemen who repeatedly engage in head-up contact and tacklers who lead with their shoulder near the head-neck junction are the highest-risk groups.

**Fit.** Neck protection should be snug enough to limit dangerous motion but not so tight that it restricts normal head movement or causes discomfort during breathing. It should be integrated with the shoulder pad system so that it moves as a unit with the pads rather than shifting independently.

## Helmet Certification and Safety Standards

Football helmet safety is governed by NOCSAE standards in the United States. Understanding these standards helps players, parents, and coaches make informed equipment decisions.

### NOCSAE Certification

Every helmet used in organized football at any level in the United States must carry a NOCSAE certification mark. This certification indicates that the helmet model has passed laboratory impact testing that simulates a range of football-relevant collision scenarios.

NOCSAE testing evaluates the Severity Index (SI) of impacts at multiple locations on the helmet shell at multiple velocities and temperatures. A helmet that exceeds the SI threshold at any test point fails certification.

**Important distinction.** NOCSAE certification means a helmet meets a minimum safety standard. It does not mean all certified helmets offer the same level of protection. Independent testing programs (such as the Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings) provide comparative ratings that evaluate how well helmets perform relative to each other, not just relative to the minimum standard.

### Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings

The Virginia Tech Helmet Rating system, developed by the university's biomechanics research group, uses a five-star scale to rate football helmets based on their ability to reduce concussion risk. Helmets are tested with a battery of impacts across multiple locations, velocities, and angles, and the results are translated into a STARS score.

**Five-star helmets** provide the best available impact performance based on current testing protocols. This rating does not guarantee concussion prevention -- no helmet can -- but it indicates that the helmet manages impact energy more effectively than lower-rated options.

Players, parents, and programs should consult the most recent Virginia Tech ratings when selecting helmets, as ratings are updated periodically with new testing data and new helmet models.

### NFL and NCAA Requirements

The NFL maintains an approved helmet list that restricts which models players may use. Helmets that score poorly on laboratory testing are removed from the approved list, and players must transition to approved models. The NFL's poster system visually ranks approved helmets from best to worst performing, and players who choose lower-ranked options must sign an acknowledgment.

The NCAA does not maintain a similarly restrictive approved list but strongly encourages the use of top-rated helmets. Some conferences and individual programs have adopted their own helmet standards that exceed NCAA minimums.

At the high school level, NOCSAE certification is the baseline requirement. Some states have adopted additional standards or recommendations based on independent testing data.

## Concussion Awareness and Equipment Limitations

No discussion of football protective equipment is complete without an honest assessment of what equipment can and cannot do regarding concussions.

**What helmets do.** Helmets are highly effective at preventing skull fractures, lacerations, and catastrophic head injuries. Modern helmets with high safety ratings also reduce the peak acceleration experienced by the brain during linear impacts.

**What helmets cannot do.** No helmet can prevent all concussions. Concussions occur when the brain moves within the skull, and this internal movement can happen even when external forces are well-managed by the helmet. Rotational forces -- which cause the brain to twist within the skull -- are particularly difficult to mitigate with helmet design alone, though technologies like MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) liners and Riddell's Axiom system are specifically designed to address rotational energy.

**The role of behavior.** Proper tackling technique (leading with the shoulder, not the crown of the helmet), rule enforcement against targeting and head-to-head hits, and a culture that supports honest injury reporting are all more impactful in reducing concussion rates than any single equipment improvement.

**Mouthguard sensors and monitoring.** Some mouthguard-based impact sensors are now being used to collect head acceleration data during games and practices. These tools provide useful data for researchers and medical staff but should not be used as the sole basis for sideline concussion diagnosis.

## Proper Equipment Fitting: A Systematic Approach

The value of every piece of protective equipment is directly proportional to how well it fits. A systematic approach to equipment fitting improves both safety and comfort.

1. **Start with the helmet.** The helmet is the foundation of the equipment stack. Fit it first and ensure it is certified, properly sized, and fully adjusted before moving on.
2. **Fit shoulder pads to the position and body.** Select the appropriate pad category for the player's position, then size for shoulder width and torso length. Verify range of motion with the pads on.
3. **Layer from the inside out.** Fit compression garments and integrated pads first, then add external pads (thigh, knee, hip) and verify that they stay in position during movement.
4. **Check the full stack.** Once all equipment is in place, have the player perform football-specific movements -- backpedal, lateral shuffle, sprint, and simulated contact. Every piece should stay in position, and no piece should restrict functional movement.
5. **Recheck periodically.** Equipment fit changes over the course of a season as bodies grow (especially at the youth and high school levels), padding compresses, and hardware loosens. Monthly fit checks are a best practice.

The time invested in proper equipment fitting is not merely administrative -- it is an investment in player safety that has tangible, measurable impact on injury rates. Programs that treat equipment fitting as a critical process, rather than a formality, consistently demonstrate better safety outcomes.
