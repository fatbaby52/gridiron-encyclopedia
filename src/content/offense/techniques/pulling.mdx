Pulling is one of the most athletic and demanding techniques an offensive lineman can perform. It requires a player to leave his initial position at the snap, move laterally behind the line of scrimmage, and deliver a block at a different point of attack — all within a matter of seconds. The pulling technique is central to gap-scheme run plays like power, counter, and trap, and it has been a staple of offensive football since the earliest days of the sport.

## What Pulling Looks Like

On a pull, the offensive lineman — most commonly a guard, though tackles and centers can pull as well — does not fire forward at the snap. Instead, he opens his hips, drops his play-side foot, and sprints laterally along the line of scrimmage toward the designated blocking point. Depending on the play call, the puller may be traveling to the same side of the formation (a "play-side pull") or crossing the entire formation to the opposite side (a "backside pull" or "cross pull").

Once the puller reaches his target area, he must locate his assigned defender and deliver a physical block. The type of block depends on the play design.

## Types of Pulling Blocks

**Kick-out block.** The puller attacks a defender on the edge — typically a defensive end or outside linebacker — and drives him inward, creating a running lane along the outside. The puller aims for the defender's outside shoulder, using his momentum and leverage to seal the edge. This block is the hallmark of the power play and creates the classic "alley" for the running back to exploit.

**Lead block (log or turn-up).** Instead of kicking the defender out, the puller turns upfield through the hole and leads the running back as a blocker. He looks to pick up the first defender who shows — usually a linebacker — and clears a path. This technique is used when the play design calls for the back to cut inside the puller's block rather than bouncing outside.

**Trap block.** On a trap play, the puller is responsible for blocking a defender who has been deliberately left unblocked. The idea is that the unblocked defender will charge upfield, putting himself in a vulnerable position. The puller attacks the defender from the side, blindsiding him and opening a lane through the interior. The trap requires precise timing — the puller must arrive at the point of attack just as the defender commits to his upfield rush.

**Wrap block.** A variation of the pull where the lineman bypasses the edge defender and wraps around to block a linebacker or safety at the second level. This is common in counter schemes where two linemen pull — the first kicks out the edge, and the second wraps through the hole to lead.

## Technique Breakdown

The pull begins with the **first step**. The lineman opens his play-side foot, pointing his toes in the direction he needs to travel. This step must be quick and shallow — a deep or wide first step slows the puller and takes him too far off the line of scrimmage, disrupting the play's timing.

The **second step** is a crossover, where the backside foot swings past the play-side foot, allowing the lineman to transition into a full sprint along the line. At this point, the puller should be low, with his pads down and his eyes up, scanning for the target defender.

**Hips and shoulders** must stay square to the line of scrimmage during the pull. A lineman who rotates his shoulders too early loses the ability to adjust to a defender's movement. Keeping the hips and shoulders level also maintains the lineman's balance and power for the block at the point of attack.

The **aiming point** depends on the block type. For a kick-out, the puller attacks the defender's outside number. For a log block, he gets his head and body between the defender and the running lane, sealing the edge inside. For a trap, the aiming point is the defender's play-side hip, delivering the block from the side.

## Common Mistakes

**Getting too deep.** Pullers who drift too far behind the line of scrimmage create a longer path to the point of attack and disrupt timing. The ideal pull is tight to the line, almost brushing the backs of the other linemen.

**Arriving late.** If the puller is slow to reach the point of attack, the running back arrives before the block is set, and the play collapses. Speed and efficiency in the pull technique are non-negotiable.

**Losing leverage.** A puller who arrives standing straight up will be unable to deliver an effective block. Maintaining a low pad level through the pull ensures the lineman can generate power at the point of contact.

**Missing the target.** The puller must have his eyes up and be able to adjust to the defender's movement. A defender who squeezes inside or widens outside can cause the puller to whiff completely if he is running blind.

## The Athleticism Factor

Pulling requires offensive linemen to be genuine athletes. The ability to move laterally at speed, change direction, and deliver a block on the move is not a skill every lineman possesses. This is why teams that run gap-scheme offenses prioritize guard prospects with explosive lateral quickness and the ability to work in space. The pulling guard is often the most athletic player on the offensive line, and his ability to execute pulls consistently is a key factor in the success of the entire run game.
