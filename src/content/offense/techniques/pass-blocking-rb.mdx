Pass protection is one of the most underappreciated skills a running back can possess — and one of the most important. When a defense sends more rushers than the offensive line can handle, the running back is the last line of defense between the blitzer and the quarterback. A back who can pick up a blitzing linebacker or safety keeps the passing play alive. One who misses the block puts the quarterback on the ground. At the NFL level, pass-protection ability is often the difference between a running back who plays on all three downs and one who is limited to early-down work.

## The Assignment

In most pass-protection schemes, the running back is responsible for the first unblocked threat that shows from outside the offensive line's protection. This is typically a blitzing linebacker or a safety coming off the edge. In slide protection, the back usually protects the side opposite the line's slide. In man protection, the back may have a specific defender assigned to him.

Before the snap, the running back must scan the defense and identify the most likely blitz threat. This requires understanding the protection call, knowing which defenders the offensive line is accounting for, and recognizing which players remain unassigned. The back must know his role before the snap — if he is reacting after the ball is snapped and a blitzer is already through the line, it is too late.

## Stance and Alignment

The running back's alignment affects his ability to execute pass protection. A back aligned directly behind the quarterback (as in the I-formation or Pistol) can see the entire defensive front and pick up blitzers from either side. A back aligned offset to one side has a better angle to protect that side but is further from threats on the opposite side.

The pre-snap stance should be balanced and athletic, with the back's weight on the balls of his feet. He should not tip the play by leaning forward (suggesting a run) or backward (suggesting pass). His eyes should be scanning the linebackers and defensive backs for blitz indicators.

## Engaging the Blitzer

When the blitz comes, the running back must react quickly and decisively. The technique involves several key elements.

**See the threat.** The back identifies the unblocked rusher and commits to engaging him. Hesitation is fatal — a half-second of indecision gives the blitzer a free run at the quarterback.

**Fit up.** The back positions himself in the rusher's path, squaring his shoulders to the defender. He should aim to establish contact slightly inside the rusher's rush lane, forcing the defender to go through him rather than around him.

**Strike with the hands.** Just like an offensive lineman, the back delivers a punch to the rusher's chest plate with his hands inside and his elbows tight. The goal is to stop the rusher's momentum and create a stalemate. The back does not need to drive the defender backward — he just needs to anchor long enough for the quarterback to throw.

**Maintain leverage.** The back must stay low, with his hips under him and his base wide. A blitzing linebacker typically outweighs the running back by 10-30 pounds and arrives with full momentum. If the back is standing upright, he will be driven into the quarterback's lap. A low center of gravity and firm base allow the back to absorb the impact and hold his ground.

**Sustain the block.** The block is not over after the initial contact. The back must continue engaging the rusher for the duration of the quarterback's drop and throw. This means active hands, resetting after any initial knock-back, and maintaining position between the rusher and the quarterback.

## Blitz Recognition

The mental component of pass protection is just as important as the physical technique. Running backs must study defensive tendencies to anticipate blitzes.

**Linebacker depth and alignment.** A linebacker who creeps toward the line of scrimmage before the snap is likely blitzing. One who shifts outside the box is a potential edge rusher. The back must read these signals and prepare accordingly.

**Safety movement.** A safety rotating down toward the box may be replacing a blitzing linebacker, or he may be the blitzer himself. Understanding the defense's blitz patterns helps the back identify the real threat.

**Hot and sight adjustments.** Sometimes the defense sends more rushers than the offense can block, even with the running back in protection. In these situations, the back and quarterback must be on the same page. The back may release into a route rather than blocking, becoming a hot-read target for the quarterback's quick throw. Recognizing when to block and when to release is a sophisticated skill that requires extensive practice.

## Common Mistakes

**Cutting the rusher.** While cut blocks can be effective in some situations, a running back who dives at a blitzer's legs in pass protection often whiffs, giving the defender a free path to the quarterback. Most coaches prefer a backs-up, square-shoulders engagement that is more reliable and sustainable.

**Waiting too long.** A back who waits for the blitzer to arrive before moving is already late. The back should attack the blitz, meeting the rusher two to three yards from the quarterback rather than at the quarterback's feet.

**Poor pad level.** Standing tall against a blitzing linebacker is a recipe for the back being knocked into the quarterback. Low pads win in the collision.

**Wrong assignment.** Picking up the wrong defender — or no defender at all — is the worst outcome. It usually results from a communication breakdown or a failure to process the protection call.

## The Value of a Blocking Back

In today's pass-heavy football, a running back who can protect the quarterback is invaluable. He allows the offense to keep five receivers in the route concept while still accounting for six or more rushers. He gives the quarterback confidence to stand in the pocket and deliver throws downfield. And he earns the trust of the coaching staff, which keeps him on the field in the most critical situations of the game.

Pass protection is not optional for a complete running back. It is essential.
