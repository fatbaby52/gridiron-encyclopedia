The route tree is football's universal language for pass patterns. It is a numbered system that assigns each fundamental route a digit from 0 to 9, providing a common framework that coaches, quarterbacks, and receivers use to communicate and design pass plays. Every route concept in football — no matter how complex — is built from combinations of these foundational routes. Understanding the route tree is essential for any player or student of the passing game.

## The Standard Route Tree

While slight variations exist between programs, the most widely used route tree assigns the following numbers:

**0 — Hitch (or Hook).** The receiver drives vertically for 5-6 yards, then stops and turns back toward the quarterback. The hitch is a high-percentage, quick-timing throw that attacks soft coverage and is one of the most commonly called routes in football.

**1 — Flat.** The receiver releases toward the sideline at a shallow depth, typically 1-3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. Flat routes are used as check-downs, screen targets, and horizontal stretches. Running backs and tight ends run flat routes frequently, but outside receivers can execute them as well.

**2 — Slant.** The receiver takes one to three hard steps vertically, then breaks sharply inside at a 45-degree angle. The slant is a timing route that must be thrown quickly, before the linebacker or safety can close the throwing lane. It is one of the most effective routes against press-man coverage.

**3 — Comeback (or Out and Up variant depending on system).** The receiver pushes vertically for 12-15 yards, then plants and comes back toward the sideline at a 45-degree angle. The comeback is a staple of the outside passing game and requires a strong-armed quarterback, as the ball must travel to the sideline while the receiver is moving back toward the line of scrimmage.

**4 — Curl (or Hook).** Similar to the hitch but run at a greater depth, typically 10-14 yards. The receiver drives vertically, then turns back toward the quarterback, settling in a soft spot in the zone. Curls are bread-and-butter intermediate routes that provide a reliable target over the middle or between zones.

**5 — Out.** The receiver drives vertically for 10-14 yards and breaks sharply toward the sideline at a 90-degree angle. The out route demands precise timing and arm strength, as the throw must reach the sideline before the cornerback can close. It is one of the most difficult routes to defend when executed correctly.

**6 — In (or Dig).** The mirror image of the out route. The receiver drives vertically for 10-14 yards and breaks sharply inside, crossing the field at a 90-degree angle. The in route (commonly called a "dig" at higher levels) attacks the middle of the field and is a favorite of quarterbacks because the receiver is running toward the throw, creating a wide target window.

**7 — Corner (or Flag).** The receiver pushes vertically for 12-15 yards, then breaks toward the corner of the end zone at a 45-degree angle. The corner route attacks the deep outside area of the field, exploiting the void between the cornerback and the safety. It is a staple of Cover 2 attacks.

**8 — Post.** The receiver drives vertically for 12-15 yards, then breaks inside toward the goal posts at a 45-degree angle. The post is one of football's most explosive routes, attacking the deep middle of the field and forcing safeties to make difficult decisions. It is the primary deep-ball route in most offenses.

**9 — Go (or Fly, Streak, Fade).** The receiver runs straight down the field at maximum speed. There is no break — the route is pure vertical. The go route threatens the defense deep and forces the cornerback to turn and run, which opens up every underneath route on the field. Even when the go is not thrown, its presence stretches the defense and creates space for other routes.

## How the Route Tree Is Used

Coaches call pass plays by assigning each receiver a number from the route tree. A play call might sound like "636" — telling the outside receiver to run an in route (6), the slot receiver to run a comeback (3), and the backside receiver to run an in route (6). The specific numbering and terminology vary by system, but the foundational concept is universal.

Route concepts are built by combining routes from the tree to create coordinated attacks against specific coverages. A "smash" concept pairs a hitch (0) with a corner (7), creating a high-low read for the quarterback against Cover 2. A "levels" concept combines routes at different depths to stretch zone coverage vertically.

## Variations and Option Routes

The route tree provides the foundation, but modern offenses add layers of complexity through route variations and option routes. A receiver may be told to run a "choice" route, where he reads the coverage and selects from two or three routes on the tree based on what the defense gives him. A "whip" route, a "stick" route, or a "banana" route are all variations built on the basic routes of the tree.

These variations keep defenses guessing and allow receivers to exploit specific defensive weaknesses. But they all begin with the same fundamental movements — the nine basic routes that make up the tree.

## Why Every Player Should Know the Tree

The route tree is not just for receivers. Quarterbacks must know every route and its timing to deliver accurate passes. Offensive linemen benefit from understanding route depth so they know how long they must sustain their blocks. Running backs who run routes out of the backfield need the same vocabulary. Even defensive players study the route tree to anticipate what the offense will do.

The route tree is football's Rosetta Stone. It translates the complexity of the passing game into a simple, organized system that every player and coach can understand. Mastering its nine routes is the first step toward understanding how the modern passing game works.
