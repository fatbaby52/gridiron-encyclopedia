The ability to catch passes out of the backfield has become one of the most important skills for a modern running back. In today's pass-heavy offenses, running backs are routinely asked to line up as receivers, run routes from the backfield, and serve as safety-valve targets for the quarterback. A back who can contribute as a receiver transforms from a one-dimensional player into a three-down weapon who creates matchup problems for every defense he faces.

## Why It Matters

Defenses defend running backs differently than they defend wide receivers. A running back who releases into a route is typically covered by a linebacker — a player who is bigger, slower, and less skilled in coverage than a defensive back. This creates a natural matchup advantage that smart offenses exploit repeatedly.

When a running back runs a route out of the backfield, the defense faces a dilemma. If a linebacker follows the back into coverage, the offense has a speed-and-agility mismatch in the passing game. If the defense substitutes a defensive back for the linebacker, it weakens its run defense. If the defense ignores the back in coverage, the quarterback has a free target.

At the NFL level, the most valuable running backs are those who can win as receivers. Players who catch 50 or more passes per season provide their offenses with a reliable outlet, a schematic weapon, and a way to keep the defense guessing on every snap.

## Routes From the Backfield

Running backs run a specific subset of the route tree, tailored to their alignment in the backfield and their role in the offensive scheme.

**Swing route.** The back releases laterally toward the sideline, running a flat, arcing path that takes him outside the offensive tackle and into the flat. The swing is a high-percentage, short throw that gives the back the ball in space with room to run. It is the most common backfield route and is often used as a check-down or as part of a screen concept.

**Angle route.** The back releases outside for two or three steps, then plants and breaks at a 45-degree angle back inside, crossing the face of any pursuing defender. The angle route is a man-coverage killer, as the change of direction is difficult for a trailing linebacker to match. It creates a clean window over the middle of the field at a depth of 5-8 yards.

**Wheel route.** The back begins with a swing or flat release, then turns upfield and runs vertically along the sideline. The wheel route is designed to exploit linebackers who jump the flat route — when the linebacker drives toward the flat, the back turns upfield behind him and is wide open deep. The wheel is one of the most explosive routes available from the backfield.

**Flat route.** A quick release to the sideline, usually no more than 2-3 yards deep. The flat route provides a fast, easy target for the quarterback under pressure and is the foundation of most check-down throws.

**Option route.** The back reads the coverage and selects his route accordingly. Against zone, he settles in an open area between defenders. Against man, he runs away from his coverage player, using a cut or break to create separation. Option routes require excellent football intelligence and a feel for defensive spacing.

**Screen route.** The back delays behind the line of scrimmage, lets the defensive rush pass him, and then catches the ball behind a wall of blockers. Screens to the running back are among the most effective plays in football when timed correctly.

## Catching Technique for Running Backs

Running backs face unique catching challenges compared to wide receivers. Many of their catches come while they are in motion — running laterally on a swing, turning upfield on a wheel, or looking back over their shoulder on an angle. This demands specific technical skills.

**Hands catches.** Just like receivers, running backs should catch the ball with their hands, not their body. The ball often arrives at awkward angles — behind the back, at his feet, or over his inside shoulder — and only a hands catch can handle these variations cleanly.

**Turning upfield.** On swing routes and flat routes, the back catches the ball moving laterally and must quickly turn his body upfield to become a runner. This transition — catch, tuck, turn — should be practiced until it is seamless. A back who catches the ball and hesitates before turning loses the advantage of receiving the ball in space.

**Tracking over the shoulder.** Wheel routes and deep swing routes require the back to catch the ball while running vertically, looking back over his shoulder. This is the same skill wide receivers use on go routes, and backs must practice it to be reliable on these high-value plays.

## Selling the Run Before Releasing

One of the running back's biggest advantages as a receiver is the ability to disguise his route with a run fake. Before releasing into his route, the back can take a step toward the line of scrimmage as if he is running the ball or picking up a block. This brief fake freezes linebackers, who are trained to read the back's initial movement as a run indicator.

Even a half-step toward the line before releasing into a swing route can cause a linebacker to bite on the run, giving the back a two-yard head start into his route. This deception is what makes backfield receiving so effective — the defense is never sure whether the back is running, blocking, or releasing into a route until it is too late.

## The Complete Back

Modern offensive football demands running backs who can do it all. The days of the pure runner — a player who takes handoffs and nothing else — are largely gone. Today's best backs are comfortable running routes, catching the ball in traffic, and contributing to the passing game as a primary target rather than a last resort.

Developing receiving skills requires dedicated practice. Running backs should work on their route running, catching mechanics, and run-after-catch ability every day, treating these skills with the same importance as their rushing technique. The back who can catch out of the backfield gives his offense an extra dimension that no defense can afford to ignore.
