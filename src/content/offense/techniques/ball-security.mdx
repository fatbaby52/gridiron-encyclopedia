Ball security is the non-negotiable foundation of running back play. A running back who fumbles loses possessions, momentum, and his coach's trust. No amount of speed, vision, or elusiveness compensates for putting the ball on the ground. Coaches at every level preach the same message: you cannot make a play if you do not have the ball. Mastering ball-security technique is the first and most important skill any ball carrier must develop.

## The High-and-Tight Carry

The standard ball-carrying technique is known as the "high-and-tight" method. It is the safest and most widely taught carry in football, and it should be the default for every ball carrier in every situation.

The technique involves five points of contact between the ball carrier and the football:

1. **Fingertips** grip the front tip of the ball, providing control over the nose.
2. **Palm and wrist** wrap around the belly of the ball, cradling it securely.
3. **Forearm** presses against the side of the ball, pinning it to the body.
4. **Bicep** squeezes the back end of the ball, applying inward pressure.
5. **Chest/ribcage** provides the final point of contact, with the ball tucked firmly against the body.

When all five points are engaged, the ball is locked in place. A defender must defeat multiple points of contact to dislodge it, making the high-and-tight carry extremely secure. The ball should be positioned high on the body — near the chest and shoulder — rather than low near the hip or waist, where it is more exposed and easier to strip.

## Arm Discipline

One of the most common ball-security mistakes is dropping the elbow away from the body while running. When the elbow lifts or separates, the ball loosens in the carrier's grip and becomes vulnerable to a punch-out or strip from the side or behind. Coaches often tell running backs to "lock the door" — keeping the elbow pressed tight against the body to seal the ball in place.

The carrying arm should remain firm but not rigid. A ball carrier who tenses his entire arm loses fluidity in his running motion. The key is maintaining constant pressure on the ball through the forearm and bicep while allowing the rest of the body to move naturally.

## Switching Hands

Running backs are taught to carry the ball in the arm closest to the sideline. When running to the right, the ball goes in the right arm. When running to the left, it goes in the left arm. This positioning keeps the ball on the outside of the body, away from defenders who are typically pursuing from the inside.

The switch occurs when the running back changes direction or crosses the field. It should be a quick, deliberate motion — never casual. The running back covers the ball with both hands during the switch, ensuring it is secure throughout the transition.

Some coaches prefer that backs never switch hands, arguing that the added complexity introduces risk. Others believe the sideline-arm principle is worth the practice time because it reduces exposure to the most common strip angle. The coaching philosophy varies, but both approaches emphasize the same core value: protect the ball at all costs.

## Ball Security in Traffic

The most dangerous moments for ball security occur in traffic — when the running back is surrounded by defenders and absorbing contact from multiple angles. In these situations, the ball carrier must "cover up" by placing both hands on the ball, sacrificing the ability to stiff-arm or reach for extra yards in favor of securing the football.

Running backs should be coached to anticipate contact and tighten their grip before the hit arrives. A loose carry through the hole that tightens on contact is a fumble waiting to happen. The grip should be firm from the moment the back receives the handoff until the whistle blows.

## The Handoff Exchange

Ball security begins at the handoff. The running back creates a pocket with his arms — inside elbow up, outside elbow down — forming a window for the quarterback to place the ball. The back's eyes should be on the hole, not the ball. He feels the ball enter the pocket and immediately clamps down with both arms, securing it before his first contact with a defender.

A fumbled exchange is one of the most demoralizing plays in football. It usually results from the back pulling away too early, the quarterback placing the ball too far forward or back, or a breakdown in the timing of the mesh. Hundreds of practice handoffs are required to make the exchange second nature.

## The Mental Side

Ball security is ultimately a mindset. Running backs who treat every carry as a chance to protect the team's most valuable asset — possession of the football — develop habits that hold up under pressure. Those who take ball security for granted eventually pay the price.

Coaches reinforce this mindset constantly. Ball-security drills — where teammates punch, swipe, and strip at the ball while the carrier runs through gauntlets — are a daily part of practice at every level. The goal is to make the high-and-tight carry so automatic that it holds up in the most violent, chaotic moments of a game.

The numbers support the emphasis. Teams that win the turnover battle win the vast majority of their games. A running back who carries the ball 20 times per game and fumbles once every 50 carries will cost his team roughly four possessions per season. That margin can be the difference between a championship and a losing record.

Ball security is not glamorous, but it is the skill that keeps a running back on the field. Master it first, and everything else follows.
