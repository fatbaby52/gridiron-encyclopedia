Blocking is the least glamorous part of a wide receiver's job — and one of the most important. A receiver who blocks opens up the run game, extends screen plays, and turns short completions into long gains. Coaches at every level evaluate receiver blocking as a critical skill, and at the highest levels, the willingness and ability to block often determines who sees the field and who sits on the bench.

## Why Receiver Blocking Matters

Football is a team game built on doing your job regardless of whether you are touching the ball. On any given running play, two or three receivers may be asked to block defenders in space — cornerbacks, safeties, or outside linebackers — to create running lanes on the perimeter. If those blocks are executed, a 5-yard gain becomes a 15-yard gain, and a 15-yard gain becomes a touchdown.

On screen passes, bubble screens, and jet sweeps, the receivers who are not catching the ball serve as the lead blockers. Their ability to engage and sustain blocks on defenders in the open field directly determines the play's success. A missed block at the perimeter turns an explosive play into a loss.

The run game benefits enormously from receiver blocking as well. Outside zone, toss plays, and sweeps all rely on the outside receivers to seal the edge or crack back on pursuing defenders. Offensive coordinators design their run game with the expectation that their receivers will do their part, and a receiver who refuses to block forces the coordinator to adjust the play calling.

## Stalk Blocking

The **stalk block** is the most common blocking technique for wide receivers. It is used when the receiver is aligned outside a defender — typically a cornerback — and must prevent that defender from reaching the ball carrier.

The stalk block begins with the receiver approaching the defender under control, breaking down into an athletic stance approximately two yards away. The receiver bends his knees, gets his feet wider than shoulder-width, and positions his hands inside with his elbows in.

From this position, the receiver mirrors the defender's movements, shuffling laterally to maintain inside leverage and prevent the defender from crossing his face. The goal is not to drive the defender backward (as an offensive lineman would) but to screen him, keeping his body between the defender and the ball carrier for as long as possible.

Timing the engage is key. A receiver who charges full-speed at a cornerback will get juked. One who breaks down too early gives the defender time to work around the block. The ideal approach is controlled aggression — fast enough to close the distance, slow enough to adjust to the defender's movements.

## Crack Blocks

A **crack block** occurs when a receiver aligned outside blocks a defender positioned inside — typically a linebacker or safety. The receiver takes an inside release off the line of scrimmage and attacks the interior defender, sealing him inside and creating a lane for the ball carrier on the outside.

Crack blocks are highly effective in the run game, especially on outside zone and sweep plays. They use the element of surprise, as the interior defender often does not see the receiver coming from his peripheral vision.

Safety is a concern with crack blocks. Because the receiver is hitting a defender who may not be expecting contact, leagues at various levels have implemented rules about crack-back blocks. In most systems, the block must be above the waist and cannot be delivered to the back or blindside of the defender. Receivers must be coached on proper technique and legal contact areas to avoid penalties and protect opponents from injury.

## Cut Blocks

Some systems ask receivers to execute **cut blocks** — low blocks aimed at a defender's thighs — on perimeter defenders. Cut blocks are effective at removing defenders from the play quickly, as even a partially successful cut forces the defender to defend his legs rather than pursue the ball carrier.

Cut blocks are controversial and heavily regulated. Many leagues restrict or prohibit them in certain situations, particularly when the blocker is moving toward his own end line or when the block comes from the side. Receivers must know the rules governing cut blocks in their specific league.

## Effort and Attitude

The most important aspect of receiver blocking is not technique — it is attitude. A receiver who approaches blocking with effort and physicality, even if his technique is imperfect, provides more value than a technically sound blocker who gives a half-hearted effort.

Coaches notice receivers who block. The player who pancakes a cornerback on a running play earns trust and playing time. The player who watches the running back get tackled while standing nearby earns a seat on the bench. Blocking is the ultimate team-first action for a wide receiver, and the best players embrace it.

## Blocking on Screens

Screen plays place receivers in a lead-blocking role, often in space against defensive backs or linebackers. The technique is similar to stalk blocking — break down, mirror, and sustain — but the moving nature of the play adds complexity. The receiver must maintain his block while moving upfield, keeping the defender engaged long enough for the ball carrier to pass.

Communication and awareness are critical on screens. Receivers must identify the most dangerous defender — the one closest to the ball carrier — and prioritize that block. Missing the key block on a screen kills the play, regardless of how well the other blockers perform.

## Development

Receiver blocking should be practiced daily. Drills that simulate stalk-blocking scenarios, crack-block timing, and screen-blocking movement build the habits that translate to game performance. Competitive drills where receivers block defensive backs in live or semi-live situations develop the toughness and confidence needed to execute in real games.

A receiver who blocks with intensity completes the offense. He makes the run game credible, extends big plays, and earns the respect of his teammates. Blocking may never make the highlight reel, but it wins football games.
