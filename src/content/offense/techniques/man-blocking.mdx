Man blocking — also commonly referred to as gap blocking — is the traditional run-blocking philosophy in football. Unlike zone schemes, where linemen block areas, man blocking assigns each offensive lineman a specific defender to block. The scheme relies on predetermined assignments, physical dominance at the point of attack, and the creation of defined running lanes through power and leverage. It is the backbone of power running games at every level of competition.

## Fundamental Concept

In a man-blocking scheme, the offensive line's responsibilities are based on a defined set of rules tied to the defensive alignment. Each lineman knows before the snap exactly which defender he will block. The blocking assignments are typically determined by counting defenders from the center outward and assigning each lineman his "man" based on that count.

The simplicity of the concept — "you block him" — belies the physical demands. Man blocking asks linemen to win one-on-one battles through superior technique, leverage, and effort. There is nowhere to hide. If a lineman loses his individual matchup, the play is likely stuffed.

## Key Plays in the Man/Gap Scheme

**Power** is the defining play of the man-blocking family. In a typical power run, the play-side linemen block down (toward the center), sealing interior defenders inside. The backside guard pulls across the formation and kicks out the play-side defensive end, while a fullback or lead blocker fills the hole between the kick-out block and the sealed interior. The running back follows the lead blocker through the designed hole.

Power is a physical, downhill run that creates a defined lane. It requires the pulling guard to be athletic enough to reach the play-side quickly and the play-side linemen to sustain their down blocks long enough for the back to hit the hole.

**Counter** uses similar blocking principles but adds misdirection. The running back takes a false step in one direction before redirecting to the play-side, where pulling linemen create the same kick-out and lead-block combination as the power play. The brief hesitation from the defense created by the running back's counter step can be the difference between a stuffed run and a big gain.

**Trap** is a quick-hitting man-scheme play that uses deception to create a running lane. The offensive line deliberately leaves an interior defender unblocked at the snap, inviting him to penetrate. A pulling guard then blocks that defender from the side — "trapping" him — as the running back shoots through the vacated gap. The trap punishes aggressive, upfield defenders and is a staple of man-blocking offenses.

**Duo** is a newer addition to the man-blocking family that has gained popularity at the NFL level. It features double teams at the point of attack with both the guard and tackle working together on one defender, while the center and opposite guard handle their man assignments. The running back reads the double team and attacks the space created.

## Technique and Leverage

Man blocking demands a specific set of physical skills. The **drive block** is the foundational technique: the lineman fires off the ball with a low pad level, strikes the defender with his hands inside the chest plate, and drives him backward or laterally to create the desired lane. Footwork is critical — the lineman must maintain a wide base with short, choppy steps to sustain power through contact.

**Down blocks** require the lineman to step at an angle toward the center of the formation, sealing a defender who is aligned inside or on his inside shoulder. The key is getting his head across the defender's body to prevent the defender from crossing back into the running lane.

**Kick-out blocks** are executed by the pulling player and require him to attack the outside shoulder of the defender at the point of attack, driving the defender inside and creating a lane along the edge.

## Advantages of Man Blocking

The man-blocking scheme offers several distinct benefits. It creates defined, predictable running lanes, which simplifies the running back's reads. Rather than reading the flow of blocks and finding a cutback lane (as in zone), the back knows exactly where the hole will be and hits it with speed and conviction.

Man blocking also concentrates force at the point of attack. The combination of down blocks, pull blocks, and lead blocks funnels multiple blockers to a single area, creating a numbers advantage at the designed gap. This makes it effective in short-yardage and goal-line situations where physical dominance is paramount.

## Disadvantages and Considerations

The scheme's rigidity is its primary weakness. Because assignments are predetermined, defensive stunts, slants, and unexpected movements can disrupt the blocking. If a defender is not where the lineman expects him to be, the block may miss entirely, and there is no "zone" safety net to compensate.

Man blocking also requires larger, more physical offensive linemen who can win one-on-one matchups consistently. Teams that lack size or power on the offensive line may struggle to execute gap schemes effectively.

Despite these challenges, man blocking remains essential to football. Its ability to create power at the point of attack and establish a physical identity makes it an indispensable component of any complete offensive system.
