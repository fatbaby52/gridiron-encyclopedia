The Post-Wheel concept is an explosive two-man combination designed to attack defenses deep down the sideline. By pairing a post route with a wheel route, the offense creates a high-low or inside-outside stretch on the safety, forcing him to commit to one route and leaving the other wide open. When executed properly, the Post-Wheel is one of the most dangerous big-play concepts in football.

## Route Structure

The Post-Wheel concept features two complementary routes. The outside receiver, typically the split end or flanker, runs a post route, breaking inside at a depth of twelve to fifteen yards and angling toward the deep middle of the field. The inside receiver, often a running back, tight end, or slot receiver, runs a wheel route, initially releasing into the flat before turning upfield and accelerating down the sideline.

The post route serves as the inside threat, pulling the safety toward the middle of the field. The wheel route exploits the vacated space along the sideline. If the safety stays to cover the wheel, the post route opens up in the deep middle.

Supporting routes usually include a backside vertical to hold the far safety and an underneath crosser or checkdown to give the quarterback a safe option if neither deep route is available.

## How It Attacks Single-High Coverages

The Post-Wheel is devastating against single-high safety structures such as Cover 1 and Cover 3. In Cover 1 (man-free), the safety is responsible for providing help over the top. The post route draws his attention to the middle of the field, and the wheel route runner, often a running back or tight end, sneaks down the sideline behind the defense. Linebackers and nickel defenders who are matched up on the wheel runner in man coverage often cannot keep up with a receiver running vertically at full speed.

Against Cover 3, the concept attacks the boundary between the deep third defender and the deep middle defender. The post pulls the deep middle safety, and the wheel runs through the seam between the deep third and the vacated middle. The cornerback responsible for the deep third must respect the vertical threat of the wheel, but if he widens to cover it, a throwing lane opens for the post behind him.

## How It Attacks Two-High Coverages

Against Cover 2, the Post-Wheel concept stresses the safety to the playside. The safety must decide whether to help on the post route running through his deep half or to cover the wheel route pushing up the sideline. If he commits to the post, the wheel runs past the cornerback who is dropping to the flat. If he jumps the wheel, the post finds the deep middle.

Against Cover 4 (quarters), the concept works by forcing the boundary safety to make a similar choice. The safety reads the vertical stem of the outside receiver and carries him on the post. The wheel route then runs free up the sideline with no deep help.

## Quarterback Reads

The quarterback typically works off a play-action fake to give the routes time to develop and to freeze the linebackers. After the fake, he sets up and reads the safety to the play side.

If the safety drifts toward the post, the quarterback throws the wheel route down the sideline, placing the ball over the receiver's outside shoulder. If the safety stays wide to cover the wheel, the quarterback delivers the post to the receiver breaking inside. The throw to the post must be placed with accuracy, leading the receiver away from the safety.

Both throws require arm strength and downfield accuracy. The Post-Wheel is not a timing throw in the traditional sense; it requires the quarterback to make a read and then drive the ball to the appropriate spot.

## Coaching Points

**For the post runner:** A strong vertical stem is critical. The receiver must push upfield hard for at least ten to twelve yards before breaking inside. If the stem is weak, the cornerback or safety will not be threatened and can sit on the route. The break should be sharp, and the receiver should accelerate through it, running away from coverage.

**For the wheel runner:** Timing is the most important element. The receiver must start in the flat, selling the short route to get the linebacker or nickel to bite, before turning upfield and running the wheel. The transition from flat to vertical should be smooth and explosive. The receiver must get up to full speed quickly to separate from any trailing defender.

**For the offensive line:** Because the Post-Wheel takes time to develop, protection must be sturdy. This concept is frequently combined with play action, which helps slow the rush, but the pocket must remain clean for three to four seconds.

## When to Use Post-Wheel

The Post-Wheel is an ideal shot play on first or second down, when the defense is not expecting a deep throw. It is especially effective after the offense has established the run or screen game, as the play-action fake becomes more convincing and the wheel route benefits from defenders expecting a short route.

In two-minute situations, the Post-Wheel can be a game-changer, producing explosive gains that move the offense quickly down the field. It is also a strong call in the red zone from outside the twenty-yard line, where the post can break into the end zone and the wheel can target the back pylon.

The Post-Wheel remains a high-risk, high-reward concept that every offense should have in its playbook for moments when a big play is needed.
