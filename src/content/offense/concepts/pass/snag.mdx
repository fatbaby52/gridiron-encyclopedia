The Snag concept is a triangle route combination that has become one of the most popular and effective passing plays at every level of football. It places three receivers in a triangular shape in one area of the field, creating multiple throwing windows that attack both man and zone coverages. The Snag is valued for its simplicity, versatility, and its ability to produce completions consistently.

## Route Structure

The Snag concept involves three routes working together on one side of the field. The outside receiver runs a corner route, pushing vertically for eight to ten yards before breaking at a forty-five degree angle toward the back pylon. The inside receiver, typically a slot or tight end, runs a snag or mini-curl route at five to six yards, settling in the gap between the linebacker and the cornerback. The third receiver, often a running back or H-back, runs a flat route toward the sideline.

These three routes form a triangle: the corner route is the high point, the snag route is the intermediate inside point, and the flat route is the short outside point. This triangle creates a clear three-option read for the quarterback, isolating the flat defender who cannot cover all three routes.

## Reading the Flat Defender

The Snag concept is built around a simple pre-snap or early post-snap read of the flat defender. This defender is typically the cornerback in Cover 3 or the outside linebacker in Cover 4. The quarterback watches this single defender and throws based on his reaction.

If the flat defender drops to cover the corner route, the snag or flat route will be open. If the flat defender sits on the snag route, the corner or flat will be available. If the flat defender flies to the flat, the snag route opens up behind him. Regardless of what the flat defender does, two of the three routes will be uncovered.

Against Cover 2, the concept works slightly differently. The corner route attacks the seam between the cornerback and the safety, while the snag and flat routes operate underneath. The quarterback reads the safety: if the safety sits on the corner route, he works to the snag; if the safety rotates deep, the corner route can be a big play.

## Effectiveness Against Man Coverage

While the Snag concept is primarily known as a zone beater, it also holds up well against man coverage. The snag route, which involves the receiver stopping and settling in a zone void, converts to a quick stick or option route against man coverage. The receiver reads the leverage of his defender and breaks away from him, creating separation at a short depth.

The corner route is a natural man beater as well, as the outside release and break toward the sideline create room against defenders playing inside leverage. The flat route is a simple outward cut that challenges the defender to keep pace in space.

## Quarterback Mechanics

The quarterback takes a three-step drop, with an optional hitch step to allow the routes to develop. His eyes should be on the flat defender from the moment of the snap. The throw to the snag route is a quick, firm pass at chest level. The throw to the corner is a touch pass with air under it, placed over the outside shoulder. The throw to the flat is a short, easy delivery.

One of the reasons the Snag concept is so popular is that none of the throws are difficult. Every option is a high-percentage pass that the quarterback can complete without elite arm strength or perfect timing. This makes the concept accessible for quarterbacks at every level.

## Coaching Points

**For the corner route runner:** The vertical stem must be aggressive. The receiver should push the cornerback's cushion and threaten to run past him before breaking to the corner. The break should be at forty-five degrees, not flat, to create separation and put the ball in a location only the receiver can catch it.

**For the snag route runner:** This is the key to the concept. The receiver must find the void in the zone and settle with his shoulders squared to the quarterback. He should sit at five to six yards, splitting the distance between the nearest defenders. Against man, he converts to an option route, breaking away from the defender's leverage.

**For the flat runner:** The flat route should be run at full speed to stretch the defense horizontally. The receiver must get outside the numbers quickly, forcing the flat defender to commit to covering him or giving up the route.

## Variations

Some coaches run the Snag concept with a slant instead of a snag route, creating a "Slant-Flat-Corner" triangle. Others replace the corner with a fade for a more vertical look. The concept can be run from almost any formation, including trips, doubles, and compressed sets, making it one of the most adaptable plays in football.

Many spread offenses feature the Snag as a primary call on early downs and in the red zone. Its reliability and simplicity make it a perfect base concept around which to build an entire passing game. Whether at the high school, college, or professional level, the Snag concept is a proven winner.
