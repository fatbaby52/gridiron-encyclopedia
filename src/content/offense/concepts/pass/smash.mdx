# Smash Concept

The smash concept is one of the most reliable and widely taught pass concepts in football. It is a two-man route combination that creates a **high-low vertical stretch** on the cornerback, putting that defender in a bind that he simply cannot win. Whether the cornerback sits on the short route or jumps the deep route, the quarterback has a clear answer. The smash concept has been a staple of passing offenses for decades, and its effectiveness has only grown as offensive systems have expanded its use and built variations around its core structure.

## Overview

At its core, smash pairs a short hitch route from the outside receiver with a corner route from the inside receiver. These two routes occupy the same vertical plane along the sideline but at different depths, creating an impossible assignment for the cornerback. If the cornerback stays low to defend the hitch, the corner route sails over his head for a big gain. If the cornerback bails or retreats to cover the deep corner, the hitch sits underneath wide open for a safe, easy completion. The concept is fundamentally a **Cover 2 beater**, but it is effective against a variety of coverages because of how it isolates and conflicts the defender.

## Execution

### Outside Receiver: Hitch Route

The outside wide receiver runs a hitch route at five to six yards. The receiver pushes upfield off the snap, selling a vertical stem to force the cornerback to respect the deep ball, then plants on the back foot and turns toward the quarterback. The receiver should settle in an open window and present a clear target. Against press coverage, the receiver must win a clean release before settling into the hitch. The aiming point is just inside the numbers, giving the quarterback a clear throwing lane.

### Inside Receiver: Corner Route

The inside receiver, typically a slot receiver or tight end, runs a corner route at 12 to 15 yards. This route requires a vertical stem to 10 yards before breaking sharply at a 45-degree angle toward the sideline and the back pylon. The stem must be vertical enough to hold the safety and prevent him from jumping the break early. The receiver should aim to stack the cornerback and create separation at the top of the route with an explosive break. The corner route is the big-play element of the concept and is designed to produce chunk yardage when the cornerback sits on the hitch.

### Quarterback Read

The quarterback's read is straightforward and efficient. He takes a five-step drop and focuses his eyes on the cornerback to the side of the concept. The read unfolds as follows:

1. **If the cornerback sits or drives on the hitch:** The quarterback throws the corner route over the top. The ball should be placed on the upfield shoulder of the receiver, leading him toward the sideline and away from the safety.
2. **If the cornerback bails, retreats, or widens to cover the corner route:** The quarterback delivers the ball to the hitch route underneath. This should be a quick, accurate throw that allows the receiver to catch and turn upfield.

The simplicity of this read is what makes smash so effective. It requires the quarterback to watch a single defender and throw to the opposite of what that defender does.

## Coaching Points

- **The hitch must be at the proper depth.** If the hitch is too deep, it crowds the cornerback's zone and shrinks the throwing window for the corner route. If it is too shallow, the concept does not create enough vertical stress. Five to six yards is the sweet spot.
- **The corner route needs a convincing stem.** If the inside receiver tips the break too early by leaning toward the sideline during the stem, the cornerback and safety can read it and close the window. A vertical push for the first 10 yards is essential.
- **The quarterback must not stare.** Looking directly at the intended target before the throw gives the cornerback an extra beat to react. The quarterback should let his eyes work through the key defender and then deliver with anticipation.
- **Understand the safety structure.** Against a single-high safety, the corner route must be thrown before the safety can rotate over the top. Against two-high safeties, the corner route is typically wide open because the safety has the deep half and cannot squeeze down to the corner area in time.

## Variations

- **Smash-seam:** A third receiver is added on a seam route to hold the safety and prevent him from floating toward the corner route. This is especially effective against Cover 2.
- **Smash-wheel:** The inside receiver fakes a short route before turning upfield on a wheel route, replacing the standard corner with an even deeper option.
- **China concept:** A variation where the outside receiver runs a deep comeback or out route instead of a hitch, changing the depth relationship while maintaining the high-low principle.
- **Double smash:** The concept is run to both sides of the formation, giving the quarterback a two-sided read and doubling the number of high-low stretches on the field.

## Level Differences

At the **youth level**, the smash concept is an excellent teaching tool for introducing quarterbacks to the idea of reading a single defender. Coaches should simplify the language to "look at the corner; throw where he isn't." Receivers should focus on running precise routes at the correct depth, and the corner route can be shortened to 10 yards to accommodate younger arms.

At the **high school level**, the smash concept becomes a primary red-zone weapon. The compressed field in the red zone makes the high-low stretch even more effective, as there is less ground for the cornerback to cover. Quarterbacks are expected to identify the coverage pre-snap and understand whether they are reading the cornerback or the safety.

At the **college level**, smash is frequently packaged with RPO elements. The quarterback may read a defensive lineman or linebacker before deciding to hand the ball off or execute the smash concept. Formations are adjusted to create favorable alignments, and motion is used to force the defense to reveal its coverage before the snap.

At the **professional level**, the smash concept is a precision play. Quarterbacks throw with anticipation, releasing the ball before the receiver has fully completed his break. Route adjustments are made based on leverage, and the concept is often combined with additional clearout routes to manipulate safeties away from the target area.
