The Sail concept is a three-level flood route combination designed to overload one side of the field with receivers at different depths. By placing three receivers along the sideline at short, intermediate, and deep levels, the offense creates a numbers advantage that puts cornerbacks and safeties in conflict. The Sail is one of the cleanest and most effective flood concepts in football, offering the quarterback a clear, progressive read from deep to short.

## Route Structure

The Sail concept features three routes distributed vertically along one side of the field. The outside receiver runs a deep corner or go route, pushing vertically to stretch the defense at the deepest level. The number two receiver, typically a tight end or slot, runs an intermediate out or sail route at twelve to fifteen yards, breaking to the sideline. The number three receiver, often a running back or inside slot, runs a flat route at three to five yards, providing the short option.

On the backside, the offense usually runs a post or dig route by the far receiver to occupy the backside safety and prevent him from rotating over to help on the flood side. A backside slant or hitch may also be included to give the quarterback a secondary read if the defense overrotates.

## How the Sail Attacks Coverage

The Sail concept is a classic "triangle" or "flood" read designed to isolate the flat defender on the playside. In most zone coverages, one defender is responsible for the flat area along the sideline. The Sail forces that defender to choose between the flat route and the intermediate out. No matter what he does, one of the two routes will be open.

Against Cover 3, the flat defender (usually a cornerback who drops to the flat or an outside linebacker) faces an impossible choice. If he sits on the flat route, the intermediate sail route comes open behind him. If he carries depth to cover the sail, the flat route is available for an easy completion. Meanwhile, the corner route threatens the deep third defender and prevents him from jumping the intermediate route.

Against Cover 2, the Sail attacks the void between the cornerback and the safety. The corner route occupies the safety and pushes him deep, while the intermediate sail finds the gap between the dropping cornerback and the deep safety. The flat route provides a checkdown if the underneath coverage takes away the intermediate throw.

Against Cover 4, the concept works by stretching the boundary safety vertically with the corner route, leaving the intermediate and flat routes to challenge the flat defender and linebacker.

## Quarterback Reads

The quarterback reads the Sail from top to bottom. He takes a five-step drop, hitches if necessary, and first looks at the corner route. If the deep defender has vacated or is late getting over, the quarterback takes the shot. If the corner route is covered, he comes down to the intermediate sail route and reads the flat defender. If the flat defender drops, he throws the sail. If the flat defender sinks under the sail, he dumps it to the flat runner.

This top-down progression is natural and easy to teach. Even young quarterbacks can learn the Sail read because the progression follows a logical sequence, and the windows are typically large.

## Coaching Points

**For the corner route runner:** A strong vertical stem is critical. The receiver must threaten the deep portion of the field for at least ten yards before breaking to the corner. If the stem is lazy or the break is rounded, the deep defender can easily cover both the corner route and the sail route underneath.

**For the sail route runner:** The intermediate out must be run at the correct depth, typically twelve to fifteen yards. The receiver should push vertically before breaking to the sideline, creating separation from the flat defender. He should settle near the sideline with his shoulders squared to the quarterback, ready to catch and get out of bounds if needed.

**For the flat runner:** The flat route should be run with urgency. The receiver must get to the sideline quickly, stretching the flat defender horizontally. He should not drift upfield; his job is to occupy the flat and provide a safe outlet if the deeper routes are covered.

## Situational Usage

The Sail is excellent in two-minute situations because it attacks the sideline, allowing receivers to get out of bounds and stop the clock. It is also a strong call on first and second downs when the offense wants to push the ball downfield without taking excessive risk.

In the red zone, the Sail can be compressed to fit the shorter field. The corner route becomes a fade, the sail becomes a sideline comeback at ten yards, and the flat remains unchanged. This adapted version creates the same three-level stretch in a tighter space.

The Sail concept remains a foundational flood principle in offensive football. Its clear reads, consistent production, and adaptability to different personnel groupings and field positions make it a concept that coaches return to time and again.
