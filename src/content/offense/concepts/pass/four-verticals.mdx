# Four Verticals

Four verticals is one of the most iconic deep passing concepts in football. At first glance it appears deceptively simple: four receivers run straight down the field. But beneath that simplicity lies a concept with built-in adjustments, option routes, and a read structure that makes it one of the most versatile and dangerous plays in any passing offense. It is a staple of Air Raid systems and has been adopted across every level of football as a way to stress defenses vertically and exploit coverage structures.

## Overview

The four verticals concept sends four eligible receivers on vertical stems down the field, dividing the defense into quarters and forcing the safeties to make difficult coverage decisions. The concept is designed to create one-on-one matchups on the outside and to put the middle of the field in conflict by attacking the seams with the two inside receivers. When executed correctly, four verticals guarantees that at least one receiver will find an open window, because no defense can cover four vertical threats with only two or three deep defenders.

The play is most commonly associated with the Air Raid offense and the spread formations popularized by coaches like Hal Mumme and Mike Leach, but it has been a fixture in pro-style offenses for decades as well.

## Execution

### Outside Receivers

The two outside wide receivers align near the sideline and push vertical at full speed from the snap. Their job is to run the corner off and maintain a vertical path along the sideline, staying within the boundary of the numbers. Against Cover 2, the outside receivers are primary targets because the cornerbacks will drop underneath and the safeties will be pulled toward the seams, leaving the deep sideline area vulnerable. The outside receiver should expect the ball on a back-shoulder or over-the-top throw when the cornerback sinks under.

### Inside Receivers (Slot or Seam Runners)

The inside receivers, typically slot receivers or tight ends, push vertically up the seams. These are the key adjustment runners in the concept. Their route is not a simple go route; it is an **option route** that adjusts based on the coverage they see as they push downfield.

- **Against Cover 2:** The inside receivers continue vertically up the seam, splitting the safeties. The ball is delivered between the two deep safeties before they can close.
- **Against Cover 3:** The inside receivers bend their routes toward the open windows between the three deep defenders, settling in the gaps at roughly 15 to 18 yards.
- **Against Cover 4 (Quarters):** The inside receivers may convert to inside-breaking dig routes at around 12 to 15 yards, because the quarters defenders will carry them vertically, leaving the intermediate middle of the field open.
- **Against single-high (Cover 1 or Cover 3):** The receiver away from the single safety runs a post or bends inside toward the vacated area.

These adjustments are what make four verticals more than just a deep ball play. The slot receivers must be intelligent route runners who can read coverage on the move and find soft spots.

### Quarterback Read

The quarterback typically takes a five-step or five-big drop and reads the safeties. The primary read is the **middle of the field**. If there is a single high safety (Cover 1 or Cover 3), the quarterback looks to the seam receiver running away from that safety. If there are two high safeties (Cover 2 or Cover 4), the quarterback reads the seam to the side of the field where the safety is slower to react or is leaning toward the outside receiver.

If the deep throws are not available, the quarterback checks down to a running back in the flat or a receiver who has settled in an open zone at the intermediate level.

## Coaching Points

- **Vertical stems must be convincing.** Every receiver must push vertically to force the defensive backs to respect the deep ball. If a receiver rounds off his route or decelerates early, the defender can jump underneath.
- **Inside receivers must read on the run.** The slot receivers cannot hesitate. They must identify the coverage structure between 10 and 12 yards and adjust their path smoothly without breaking stride.
- **Quarterback must trust the seam throw.** The seam throw between two safeties in Cover 2 is a tight-window throw. The quarterback must put the ball high and in front of the receiver with anticipation. Waiting too long allows the safeties to close the window.
- **Protection must hold.** Four verticals requires time because the routes develop at 15 to 25 yards downfield. A five-man protection scheme must be solid, and the offensive line must be prepared for delayed blitzes.

## When to Call It

Four verticals is best deployed when the offense identifies a coverage it can exploit. It is a premier play against Cover 2, where the seams and deep sidelines are structurally vulnerable. It is also effective as a constraint play against defenses that are sitting on short passes or playing aggressive run support, as the deep vertical push punishes defenders who cheat forward. On the field, it is commonly called on early downs after establishing the run, or as a shot play after a change of possession when the defense may be playing conservatively.

## Level Differences

At the **youth level**, four verticals is often simplified to a pure go-route concept. Coaches focus on running fast in a straight line and on the quarterback throwing the ball deep to the best one-on-one matchup. Route adjustments are generally not taught until players mature.

At the **high school level**, coaches introduce the seam-read concept for inside receivers. The quarterback begins learning to read the safeties pre-snap and direct his eyes accordingly. Protection schemes become more refined to buy time for the routes.

At the **college level**, four verticals is a weekly staple in spread and Air Raid systems. Slot receivers are expected to make full coverage reads on the move, and quarterbacks are coached to manipulate safeties with their eyes before delivering the ball. RPO tags and hot routes are often packaged with the concept.

At the **professional level**, four verticals is a calculated shot play. It is used strategically based on film study, field position, and game situation. Quarterbacks at this level read the entire field and can hit any of the four receivers based on post-snap movement. Protections include chips, slides, and max-protect schemes to give the quarterback sufficient time.
