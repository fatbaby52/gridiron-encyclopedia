Run-Pass Options, commonly known as RPOs, have transformed modern football at every level. An RPO combines a designed run play with a built-in passing option, allowing the quarterback to make a post-snap decision to either hand the ball off or throw a quick pass based on the reaction of a specific defender. This concept forces defenses into impossible conflicts, as they cannot simultaneously commit to stopping the run and covering every receiver.

## Foundational Principle

The RPO works because of a simple truth: when the defense commits defenders to stop the run, it leaves fewer players in coverage. Conversely, when the defense drops into coverage, it has fewer defenders at the point of attack to stop the run. The RPO exploits this tension by giving the quarterback the ability to choose the best option after the snap.

Unlike traditional play-action, where the decision to pass is made before the snap and the run fake is purely deceptive, the RPO involves a genuine run play. The offensive line blocks for the run, the running back prepares to take the handoff, and the quarterback reads a specific defender to determine whether to give the ball or pull it and throw.

## Types of RPOs

**Pre-Snap RPOs:** Some RPOs involve the quarterback making his decision based on the defensive alignment before the snap. If the defense shows a light box with extra defenders in coverage, the quarterback hands the ball off. If the defense stacks the box, the quarterback knows he will throw a quick pass to take advantage of the reduced coverage. While not a true post-snap read, these are still classified as RPOs because the run and pass options are built into the same play.

**Post-Snap Glance RPOs:** The most basic post-snap RPO involves the quarterback reading a single defender, typically an inside linebacker or safety. On the mesh with the running back, the quarterback glances at the read key. If the defender steps forward into a run gap, the quarterback pulls the ball and throws a quick pass, usually a slant, bubble, or hitch behind the vacated area. If the defender stays in coverage, the quarterback hands the ball off to the running back.

**Second-Level RPOs:** These are more advanced concepts where the quarterback reads a second-level defender, such as a safety or outside linebacker, after the initial mesh point. These RPOs often involve slightly deeper throws, such as a stick route behind the linebackers or a glance post over the top. They require the quarterback to hold the ball slightly longer but can produce explosive plays.

**Third-Level RPOs:** The most aggressive RPOs involve the quarterback reading a deep safety and deciding whether to throw a shot play down the field. These are rare and require elite arm talent and processing speed, but they have been used effectively at the college and NFL levels.

## Key Defenders to Read

The specific defender the quarterback reads depends on the RPO design. On inside zone RPOs, the read key is often the backside linebacker. If the linebacker fills his run gap, the quarterback throws the quick pass. If the linebacker stays in his zone drop, the quarterback hands off.

On outside zone or stretch RPOs, the read key might be the playside outside linebacker or the overhang defender. If that defender squeezes down to defend the run, the quarterback throws a bubble or quick out to the receiver aligned outside the read key.

Some RPOs read a defensive end or edge player, similar to a traditional option play. The quarterback reads whether the end crashes inside or stays wide, and makes his give-pull decision accordingly.

## Coaching Points

**For the quarterback:** The read must be decisive. The quarterback has roughly one second to make his decision at the mesh point. If he hesitates, the timing of the quick throw is disrupted, and the offensive line, which is run blocking, may get flagged for being downfield on a pass.

**For the offensive line:** The linemen must block as if the play is a run on every RPO. They cannot tip off the defense by pass blocking on an RPO, as that would alert the read key to drop into coverage. However, linemen must also be aware of the three-yard rule in the NFL, which restricts how far downfield they can be when a pass is thrown. In college, the rule is more lenient, but linemen still need to stay near the line of scrimmage.

**For the receivers:** The pass options on an RPO must be quick-developing routes. Slants, hitches, bubbles, and stick routes are the most common because they allow the ball to be delivered before the offensive line gets too far downfield.

## Rules and Limitations

The legality of RPOs depends on the offensive linemen staying within the legal limit downfield when a pass is thrown. In the NFL, linemen may not be more than one yard beyond the line of scrimmage when a forward pass is released. In college football, the limit is three yards. This constraint limits the types of run schemes that can be paired with RPOs, as some run plays require the linemen to get to the second level immediately.

## Impact on Modern Football

RPOs have fundamentally changed how defenses approach the game. Defensive coordinators can no longer simply load the box to stop the run, because the quarterback will throw a quick pass for an easy completion. Similarly, they cannot simply drop into coverage, because the run game will have a numbers advantage. This chess match has made RPOs a central feature of offensive football from high school to the NFL, and their influence continues to grow.
