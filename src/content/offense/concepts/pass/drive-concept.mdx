The Drive concept, sometimes called the Drag concept, is a two-man crossing route combination that attacks defenses horizontally with receivers working across the field at different depths. It is one of the most versatile and dependable concepts in football, effective against both man and zone coverages, and it can be run from virtually any formation with any personnel grouping.

## Route Structure

The Drive concept features two crossing routes running in opposite directions at staggered depths. The primary route is a shallow drag, run by a receiver at approximately two to three yards depth, sprinting across the formation. The complementary route is a deeper in-cut or intermediate crossing route at ten to twelve yards, working across the field in the opposite direction of the drag.

The two crossers traveling in opposite directions create natural traffic in the middle of the field. Defenders in man coverage must navigate through the congestion of the offensive formation and the other crosser, often losing ground in the process. Zone defenders are stretched horizontally, as they must account for two receivers moving in different directions.

Supporting routes typically include a vertical clearout on each side of the field to push the safeties deep and create room for the intermediate crosser. A checkdown route by the running back provides a safety valve if both crossers are covered.

## How It Defeats Man Coverage

The Drive concept is one of the premier man-coverage beaters in football. The crossing action creates natural pick situations as the two receivers pass through the formation in opposite directions. Defenders trailing their assigned receivers must fight through traffic, including offensive linemen, the other crosser, and other receivers running routes.

The shallow drag runner has the advantage of speed and timing. By crossing the formation at full speed behind the offensive line, he forces the trailing defender to navigate around obstacles. Even a momentary delay by the defender creates enough separation for the quarterback to deliver the ball.

The deeper crosser also benefits from the traffic. As the shallow drag clears through one side, defenders in the middle of the field are occupied, creating a clean lane for the intermediate crossing route.

## How It Attacks Zone Coverage

Against zone defenses, the Drive concept creates the same high-low dilemma as other crossing concepts. The underneath zone defenders, typically linebackers, must decide which crosser to follow. If a linebacker carries depth with the intermediate crosser, the drag comes free underneath. If the linebacker stays shallow with the drag, the intermediate route opens behind him.

The fact that the two crossers travel in opposite directions makes the zone read even more difficult. A defender cannot wall off both routes simultaneously because they are moving away from each other. At least one of the two crossers will find a void in the zone.

Against Cover 3, the concept attacks the seams between the hook defenders and the curl-flat defenders. Against Cover 2, it works the areas between the linebackers, where the intermediate crosser can find space between the dropping middle linebackers and the deep safety.

## Quarterback Reads

The quarterback typically takes a three-step or five-step drop and reads the concept from high to low. He first checks the intermediate crossing route. If the window is open between the linebackers, he delivers the ball with anticipation, leading the receiver across the field. If the intermediate route is covered, he comes down to the drag underneath, throwing the ball in front of the receiver and letting him run to it.

Against man coverage, the quarterback may look to the drag first, knowing that the crossing action will create separation against trailing defenders. The throw to the drag is typically a firm ball delivered at chest height, allowing the receiver to catch and turn upfield immediately.

## Coaching Points

**For the shallow drag runner:** Speed across the formation is paramount. The receiver should aim to run at no more than two to three yards depth, staying as flat as possible. He should use the offensive line and other bodies in the middle as obstacles for the trailing defender. After catching the ball, the receiver should immediately look upfield for yards after the catch.

**For the intermediate crosser:** A convincing vertical stem is necessary before breaking across the field. The receiver should push upfield for eight to ten yards before cutting across, ensuring that he creates enough separation from the underneath defenders. Against zone, he should settle in the open window rather than running full speed through coverage.

**For the offensive line:** Standard pass protection is used for the Drive concept. The offensive line does not need to execute any special techniques, but they should be aware that receivers will be crossing behind them, and their positioning can inadvertently help or hinder the play.

## Versatility and Adjustments

The Drive concept can be run from any formation: pro, spread, trips, ace, or empty. It can be tagged with additional route combinations on the backside, such as a curl-flat or fade, to give the quarterback extra options. It pairs well with play-action, as the run fake holds the linebackers and creates bigger windows for the crossers.

Some offenses run the Drive concept with both crossers running in the same direction, creating a "levels" look rather than a traditional drive. Others add a wheel route by the running back, providing a third option that stresses the defense vertically after the horizontal crossers have cleared out the middle.

The Drive concept remains a universal building block of the passing game. Its effectiveness against both man and zone, combined with its simplicity and versatility, makes it an essential part of any offense.
