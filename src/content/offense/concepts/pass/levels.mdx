The Levels concept is one of the most effective and widely taught zone-beating pass plays in football. It places two receivers on crossing routes at different depths, creating a horizontal stretch that forces underneath defenders to choose which level to cover. The result is almost always an open receiver, making Levels a reliable staple in any offensive playbook.

## Route Structure

The Levels concept uses two crossers running in the same direction at different depths. The first crosser, often a tight end or inside receiver, runs a shallow drag at approximately five to six yards. The second crosser, typically an outside receiver from the opposite side, runs a deeper in-cut or dig at twelve to fifteen yards. Both routes travel across the formation in the same direction.

Supporting routes usually include a backside vertical or post to clear out the deep safety and a flat or swing route by the running back to provide a checkdown and stretch the defense horizontally. Some coaches add a backside curl to give the quarterback a full-field progression.

## Why Levels Dominates Zone Coverage

Zone defenses rely on defenders occupying specific areas of the field. The Levels concept is designed to put those defenders in impossible situations. When two receivers cross at different depths, the hook or curl defender cannot cover both. If he sinks to take away the deeper crosser, the shallow drag comes free underneath. If he jumps the drag, the dig route opens up behind him.

The concept is particularly devastating against Cover 3, where three defenders are responsible for the deep thirds and four underneath defenders must cover the short and intermediate zones. The two crossers run directly through the seams of the underneath coverage, and at least one will find an open window.

Against Cover 2, the Levels concept attacks the area behind the linebackers and in front of the safeties. The deeper crosser settles in the hole between the middle linebacker and the safety, while the shallow crosser works underneath the linebacker level.

## Quarterback Progression

The quarterback reads this concept from high to low. His first look is the deeper crossing route at the intermediate level. If the window is open, he delivers the ball with authority, leading the receiver across the field. If the intermediate route is covered by a sinking linebacker or safety, the quarterback works down to the shallow drag underneath.

The timing of the reads is critical. Against zone, the quarterback should not hold the ball waiting for the deep crosser to come open. If the window is not there on his initial read, he should quickly transition to the shallow crosser, who will be running in space with an opportunity for yards after the catch.

If both crossers are covered, the quarterback checks down to the running back in the flat or the backside curl route. A well-designed Levels concept gives the quarterback three or four options in his progression, ensuring he almost always has a safe throw available.

## Coaching Points

**For the shallow crosser:** The drag route should be run at a consistent depth of five to six yards, staying flat across the formation. The receiver should not drift upfield. Speed across the middle is important because the receiver must clear the traffic quickly and get into open space. Against zone, he should be ready for the ball immediately after passing the first linebacker.

**For the deeper crosser:** The receiver must sell the vertical route before breaking inside. A strong push upfield for ten to twelve yards forces the cornerback to respect the deep route, which in turn creates more separation on the in-cut. After the break, the receiver should find the open window in the zone and settle rather than running through coverage.

**For the offensive line:** Standard five-step drop-back protection is typically used. The concept does not require extensive time to develop, but clean pockets allow the quarterback to see the full field and deliver accurate throws at the intermediate level.

## Situational Applications

Levels is an excellent third-down call, particularly on third-and-medium distances of five to eight yards. The two crossers ensure that the offense has options at the sticks, and the shallow drag provides a reliable chain-mover even if the defense takes away the deeper route.

The concept is also effective in the red zone, where compressed field dimensions make it harder for defenders to cover both levels. Inside the twenty-yard line, the deeper crosser may convert his route to a quick in-cut at eight to ten yards, adjusting to the reduced space.

## Variations

Many offenses run Levels with a play-action fake to hold linebackers and create larger windows. Others tag a wheel route onto the concept, sending the running back up the sideline after the defense reacts to the crossers. The core principle remains the same: present two targets at different depths and let the defense choose which one to give up.

The Levels concept endures because it is simple to teach, easy for the quarterback to read, and consistently effective against the zone coverages that dominate modern football. It is a foundational concept that every serious offensive coach should have in the playbook.
