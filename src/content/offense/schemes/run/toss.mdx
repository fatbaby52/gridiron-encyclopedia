The Toss, also known as the Toss Sweep or Pitch Sweep, is an outside run play that gets the ball to the running back quickly at the edge of the formation. Rather than a traditional handoff, the quarterback pitches or tosses the ball to the running back, who catches it on the move and attacks the perimeter with blockers leading the way. The Toss is designed to outflank the defense by using speed and leverage, getting the running back outside the tackle box before the defense can react.

## How the Toss Works

The play begins with the quarterback receiving the snap and immediately tossing or pitching the ball to the running back, who is aligned to the side of the playside. The toss is a soft, underhand pitch that allows the back to catch the ball in stride while running laterally toward the sideline.

As the ball is tossed, the offensive line and other blockers execute their assignments to clear a path for the running back. Depending on the scheme, one or two linemen may pull to the outside to lead the way, while the remaining linemen execute down blocks or reach blocks to seal the interior defenders inside.

The wide receivers and tight ends on the playside are responsible for blocking the perimeter defenders, including the cornerbacks and outside linebackers. These perimeter blocks are critical to the success of the Toss, as the play lives and dies on the edge.

## Blocking Schemes

There are several blocking variations for the Toss play, depending on the offensive system.

**Power Toss:** This version features a pulling guard and sometimes a pulling tackle who lead the running back around the edge. The playside linemen execute down blocks, and the pulling linemen kick out the force defender and lead through the hole. This is the most physical version of the Toss, combining outside speed with gap-scheme power.

**Zone Toss:** In this variation, the offensive line executes outside zone blocking, with each lineman taking a lateral step and working to reach the defender to his outside. The running back reads the blocks and looks for the first available lane, either bouncing outside or cutting back inside if the defense overflows to the sideline.

**Crack Toss:** A common spread variation where a wide receiver or slot runs a crack block on the force defender, typically the outside linebacker or strong safety. The crack block seals the edge, and the running back turns the corner with a pulling guard or H-back leading the way.

## The Running Back's Role

Speed is the primary attribute for a Toss runner. The running back must catch the pitch cleanly, secure the ball, and accelerate to the outside as quickly as possible. His initial path is wide, aiming for a point two to three yards outside the tight end or tackle.

The running back reads the force defender and the lead blockers as he approaches the edge. If the kickout block is successful and the edge is sealed, the back turns upfield and accelerates through the lane. If the defense strings the play to the sideline, the back must decide whether to turn the corner with speed or cut back against the grain if a lane opens inside.

The Toss demands a running back with speed, ball security, and the ability to make decisions on the move. Unlike downhill runs where the back can patiently wait for a hole to develop, the Toss requires immediate reads and quick acceleration.

## Why the Toss Is Effective

The Toss stretches the defense horizontally more aggressively than almost any other run play. Because the running back receives the ball on the move and already has momentum toward the sideline, the defense must react instantly or risk being outflanked. Pursuit angles become critical, and any defender who takes a wrong step or is slow to react can be completely eliminated from the play.

The Toss is also effective because it forces the defense to account for the width of the field. Defenses that load the box to stop inside runs become vulnerable to the Toss, as there are fewer defenders on the edge to set the force and contain the runner.

Additionally, the Toss creates big-play opportunities. When the running back turns the corner with blockers in front, the play can break for significant yardage. The open-field nature of the play rewards speed and agility, and a single missed tackle can result in a touchdown.

## Coaching Points

**For the quarterback:** The toss must be accurate and soft. The ball should arrive at the running back's chest or midsection, allowing him to catch it in stride without breaking pace. A high, hard, or behind-the-back toss can result in a fumble or lost momentum.

**For the pulling linemen:** Speed to the edge is essential. The pulling linemen must clear the formation quickly and get to the perimeter before the defense. The kickout block on the force defender must be physical and decisive, sealing the edge for the running back.

**For the receivers:** Perimeter blocks are the difference between a moderate gain and a big play. Wide receivers must engage the cornerbacks aggressively, sustaining their blocks long enough for the running back to clear the area.

## Situational Use

The Toss is an excellent change-of-pace play that keeps the defense honest on the edges. It is particularly effective on first down, when the defense may be aligned to stop inside runs, and in open-field situations where the running back's speed can be maximized. The Toss also pairs well with play-action bootleg passes, as the wide action of the Toss can be faked to set up a naked bootleg or waggle pass to the opposite side.
