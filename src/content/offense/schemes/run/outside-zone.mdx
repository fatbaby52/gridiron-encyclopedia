## Overview

Outside zone, commonly called **stretch** or **wide zone**, is a lateral run concept designed to threaten the edge of the defense and force defenders to make difficult decisions on the move. While inside zone compresses the defense vertically, outside zone stretches it horizontally, creating cutback lanes when defenders overrun the play.

The running back's aiming point is the **tight end's outside hip** or the area just outside the last man on the line of scrimmage. However, the play is not purely an outside run. Its true power lies in the combination of the outside threat and the cutback. When the defense flows hard to the sideline to stop the stretch, running lanes open backside for a decisive runner who can plant and cut against the grain.

Outside zone is a staple of the Shanahan coaching tree, which has produced some of the most productive rushing attacks in NFL history. The scheme favors athletic offensive linemen who can move laterally and reach defenders at the point of attack.

## Execution

At the snap, every offensive lineman takes an aggressive **reach step**—a lateral step toward the playside at roughly a 45-degree angle. The goal is to get the helmet to the playside number of the defender and seal him from the play. This is a more lateral and aggressive first step than inside zone, reflecting the wider aiming point of the play.

Covered linemen attempt to reach the defender aligned over them. If the reach is successful and the defender is sealed inside, the play hits outside. If the defender fights the reach and stays on the playside shoulder, the lineman rides him past the play—this is called "washing" the defender down the line. That washed defender creates a natural cutback lane behind him.

Uncovered linemen take the same reach step, looking to help on the nearest playside threat before working to the second level. The backside of the line must also execute well. The backside tackle and guard need to cut off pursuit from the backside defensive end and three-technique, preventing them from running the play down from behind.

The running back takes the handoff on a path aiming for the edge. His eyes read the **defensive end** or the C-gap defender. If the end is sealed inside, the back bounces outside and turns upfield. If the end sets the edge and forces the play back inside, the back plants his outside foot and cuts back into the first available lane. Great outside zone runners can make multiple cuts—first pressing outside, then cutting back, then potentially bending the run again if a lane opens further backside.

The quarterback opens away from the running back, executes the mesh, and then carries out a naked bootleg fake to hold the backside defender. This fake is a critical component, as play-action off outside zone is one of the most effective passing concepts in football.

## Coaching Points

Offensive linemen must prioritize **lateral movement** over vertical push in the first two steps. Coaches emphasize "flat down the line" before turning upfield. If a lineman turns upfield too early, he creates a gap between himself and the next lineman that the defense can exploit.

The running back must be disciplined about reading the blocks **from the outside in**. The first read is the edge—can he get outside? If not, each successive cutback lane is the next option. Coaches teach backs to "press it, press it, cut it." The back should threaten the outside as long as possible before making a definitive cut.

Timing is everything. The mesh between the quarterback and running back must be smooth and at the correct depth. If the back gets the ball too deep, the defense has time to flow and close lanes. If the mesh is too shallow, the back does not have the angle to threaten the edge.

## Common Mistakes

The most damaging error is a running back who **cuts back too early**, before the stretch has had time to move the defense laterally. The entire point of outside zone is to displace defenders from their gaps. If the back cuts immediately, the defense has not moved and the cutback lane does not exist.

Offensive linemen frequently make the mistake of **lunging on reach blocks** rather than maintaining balance and leverage. A defender who defeats a reach block has a clear path to the running back. Linemen must stay on their feet and sustain contact even when they cannot complete the full reach.

Another common issue is the **backside of the line giving up pursuit**. If the backside guard or tackle loses his assignment, a defender chasing from behind can tackle the back just as he finds a lane. Effort and technique on the backside are just as important as on the playside.

## Level Differences

In the NFL, outside zone is often run from one-back sets with multiple wide receivers, spreading the defense and creating wider running lanes on the edge. The Shanahan-style offense pairs it extensively with boot-action passing, creating a run-pass conflict that is difficult to defend consistently.

At the college level, outside zone is a cornerstone of spread offenses. Many programs add a zone-read component, where the quarterback reads the backside end rather than blocking him. This eliminates the need for a backside cut block and adds another dimension to the play.

High school teams can run outside zone effectively but must invest significant practice time in reach-step technique. The play demands more athleticism from offensive linemen than inside zone or gap schemes, so programs with less experienced lines may find it difficult to execute consistently.

## Related Concepts

Outside zone is closely tied to inside zone, as the two plays form a complete zone-running package. Play-action passes off outside zone, particularly bootleg and naked concepts, are among the most efficient passes in football at every level.
