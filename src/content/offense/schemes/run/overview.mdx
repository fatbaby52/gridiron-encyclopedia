## Overview

Run schemes in football fall into two primary families: **zone schemes** and **gap schemes**. Each family uses fundamentally different blocking rules and asks the running back to read different keys. Every offensive coordinator must decide how to balance these two families within their playbook, and that decision shapes the identity of the entire offense.

A run scheme is more than just a play call. It is a philosophy that dictates how the offensive line communicates, how the running back processes information, and how the offense attacks defensive fronts. The best offenses commit to a primary scheme family and build constraint plays around it, forcing defenses to defend multiple concepts with the same personnel.

## Zone Schemes

In zone schemes, offensive linemen block an area rather than a specific defender. They take lateral steps at the snap and work in combination blocks, climbing to the second level as defenders are sealed. The running back reads the blocks and finds the open lane.

The two primary zone concepts are **inside zone** (targeting the A or B gap) and **outside zone** (stretching to the C gap or beyond). Zone schemes are popular because they use simple, repeatable rules and can be run from any formation. The offensive line does not need to identify specific defenders pre-snap in the same way gap schemes require. Instead, linemen follow covered and uncovered rules: if a defensive lineman is aligned over you, block him; if not, help your neighbor before climbing to a linebacker.

Zone running demands patience from the back. Rather than hitting a predetermined hole at full speed, the runner presses the line of scrimmage, reads how blocks develop, and cuts to daylight. This makes zone schemes adaptable to multiple defensive fronts and stunts.

## Gap Schemes

Gap schemes assign each blocker a specific gap or defender. They typically involve **pulling** linemen—guards or tackles who leave their position to lead through a different hole. The running back follows predetermined blocking to a designated point of attack.

Key gap concepts include **power** (pulling guard with a lead blocker), **counter** (misdirection with two pullers), and **trap** (allowing penetration then blocking the defender from the side). Gap schemes create angles and leverage by moving blockers to the point of attack, generating numerical advantages at the hole.

The running back's job in gap schemes is more straightforward: follow your lead blocker and run downhill. There is less lateral movement and fewer reads compared to zone. Gap runs tend to produce more physical, downhill running and are particularly effective when an offense needs short yardage or wants to impose its will on a defense.

## Choosing a Scheme

Most offenses blend both families. Zone schemes offer versatility and simplicity. Gap schemes provide physicality and are effective in short-yardage situations. The choice often depends on personnel—athletic linemen favor zone, while powerful linemen favor gap.

Coordinators also consider the defensive tendencies they expect to face. If opponents rely on aggressive, upfield defensive linemen, trap and counter schemes that exploit that aggressiveness can be devastating. If defenses play disciplined, gap-sound football, zone schemes that force lateral movement and create cutback lanes may be more effective.

## Level Differences

At the high school level, gap schemes like power and counter are more common due to their straightforward assignments. High school linemen may not have the footwork or experience to execute zone combination blocks consistently, making the clear-cut assignments of gap blocking more reliable.

College and NFL offenses lean heavily on zone concepts, though both levels mix in gap runs situationally. The NFL in particular has embraced wide zone and split zone as foundational plays, often pairing them with play-action passes that exploit linebacker movement. College offenses frequently integrate read options into both zone and gap schemes, adding the quarterback as a run threat.

## Related Concepts

Understanding run schemes requires knowledge of offensive line techniques, running back reads, and how defenses align to stop the run. Each scheme interacts with formation, motion, and play-action in ways that create a complete offensive system.
