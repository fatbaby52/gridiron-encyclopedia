The QB Power Read, also known as the Inverted Veer, is a read-option play that flips the traditional option concept. Instead of the running back hitting the inside gap while the quarterback keeps outside, the QB Power Read sends the running back on a sweep outside while the quarterback reads the edge defender and potentially keeps the ball on a power run inside. This inversion of roles creates confusion for the defense and makes the play extremely difficult to defend, especially when the quarterback is a capable runner.

## How the QB Power Read Works

The play begins with the quarterback and running back in a shotgun or pistol alignment. At the snap, the running back takes a path across the formation as if running a sweep or jet action to the outside. The quarterback places the ball in the running back's belly during the mesh, reading the unblocked backside defensive end.

If the defensive end stays inside or squeezes to take away the quarterback's running lane, the quarterback gives the ball to the running back, who runs the sweep outside. If the defensive end widens or chases the running back to the outside, the quarterback pulls the ball and runs inside the vacated gap, following the pulling guard and lead blockers on a power run.

The blocking scheme is typically a power scheme on the inside, with a pulling guard leading through the hole for the quarterback. This gives the quarterback a lead blocker and a clear lane if he decides to keep the ball. On the outside, the receivers and any additional blockers seal the edge for the running back on the sweep.

## The Inversion Principle

The traditional Read Option has the running back going inside and the quarterback keeping outside. The QB Power Read inverts this by sending the back outside and the quarterback inside. This inversion creates several advantages.

First, it puts the defense in a different conflict than they are accustomed to. Defenders who have been drilled to handle the standard Read Option, where the end crashes on the back and the linebacker scrapes for the quarterback, are suddenly faced with the opposite scenario. The end must now decide whether to chase the sweep or stay home for the quarterback power, and the linebacker must react to a different flow.

Second, the inversion allows the offense to use gap-scheme blocking for the quarterback run. Unlike the standard Read Option, where the quarterback keeps on a zone run with no lead blocker, the QB Power Read features a pulling guard or fullback who leads the quarterback through the hole. This makes the quarterback keep more physical and harder to stop.

Third, the sweep option by the running back attacks the perimeter with speed, stretching the defense horizontally. If the defense focuses on stopping the quarterback inside, the sweep can break for big yardage outside.

## Blocking Scheme

The offensive line blocks a power or gap scheme on the inside. The playside linemen execute down blocks, sealing the interior defenders inside. The backside guard pulls across the formation and leads through the hole for the quarterback, kicking out the playside linebacker or the first defender in the gap.

On the outside, the playside receiver blocks the cornerback, and the tight end or slot blocks the outside linebacker, creating a lane for the running back if the ball is given on the sweep.

The unblocked defender is the read key, usually the backside defensive end. He is left alone because the offense does not need to block him. Whichever option the end takes away, the other option becomes the correct call.

## Quarterback Reads and Mechanics

The quarterback's read is straightforward. At the mesh point, he watches the unblocked defensive end. If the end crashes inside or holds his ground, the quarterback gives the ball to the running back on the sweep. If the end widens to chase the back, the quarterback pulls and follows the pulling guard inside.

The mesh must be clean and deliberate. The quarterback extends the ball into the running back's belly, holds it there while reading the end, and then either seats it or pulls it based on the read. The pull action must be decisive because the pulling guard is already in motion and the quarterback must time his run to fit behind the lead blocker.

After pulling the ball, the quarterback attacks the hole aggressively, running downhill behind the pulling guard. He must read the guard's block and cut accordingly, either inside or outside the block depending on the defender's reaction.

## Why the QB Power Read Is Effective

The QB Power Read is one of the most difficult plays in football to defend because it presents the defense with conflicting assignments. The edge defender cannot be right: if he takes the quarterback, the sweep runs free outside; if he takes the sweep, the quarterback runs a gap-scheme power play inside with a lead blocker.

The play is particularly devastating with athletic quarterbacks who can run between the tackles. When the quarterback pulls the ball and attacks the line of scrimmage behind a pulling guard, he becomes a powerful runner with a lead blocker, and the defense has already lost a defender to the sweep action.

## Coaching Points

**For the quarterback:** Trust the read. The quarterback must be disciplined about giving the ball when the read says give, even if he wants to run. On the keep, he must follow the pulling guard and hit the hole with conviction. He should not try to create on his own; the blocking scheme is designed to produce a lane.

**For the running back:** The sweep path must be full speed and convincing. The back cannot slow down at the mesh or peek at the read key. Whether he receives the ball or not, his effort must look identical. If he receives the ball, he should attack the edge aggressively, reading the perimeter blocks.

**For the pulling guard:** The guard must get to the point of attack quickly and deliver a physical block on the first defender in the lane. His kick-out block is the key to the quarterback keep; without it, the quarterback runs into unblocked defenders.

## Strategic Value

The QB Power Read is an excellent complement to the standard Read Option. By pairing both plays in the same offense, the defense can never settle into a single assignment for the edge defender. One play has the quarterback keeping outside; the other has him keeping inside. This constant conflict makes it extremely difficult for the defense to prepare for both scenarios.

The play is also a powerful red-zone weapon. Inside the twenty-yard line, where space is compressed and the defense is focused on stopping inside runs, the sweep option stretches the defense to the perimeter. Meanwhile, the quarterback power inside benefits from the pulling guard and the defense's uncertainty about where the ball is going.
