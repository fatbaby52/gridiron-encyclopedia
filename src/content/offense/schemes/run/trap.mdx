The Trap is one of the oldest and most fundamental gap-scheme run plays in football. It uses misdirection and deception at the line of scrimmage to create running lanes by deliberately leaving a defender unblocked, allowing him to penetrate, and then kicking him out with a pulling lineman from the opposite side. The Trap punishes aggressive defensive linemen who crash hard upfield and has remained a staple of offensive playbooks for over a century.

## How the Trap Works

The Trap play is built on a simple deception. The offensive lineman aligned across from the targeted defender does not block him at the snap. Instead, that lineman bypasses the defender and works to the second level to block a linebacker. The unblocked defensive lineman, seeing no resistance, charges upfield into the backfield, expecting to disrupt the play.

Meanwhile, an offensive lineman from the opposite side of the formation, typically the backside guard, pulls across the formation and delivers a kick-out block on the unblocked defender. This kick-out block drives the penetrating defender sideways, clearing the running lane. The running back takes the handoff and hits the gap created by the kick-out, running behind the pulling guard's block.

The result is a classic bait-and-switch. The defender is lured into the backfield by the lack of initial resistance, only to be blindsided by the pulling guard. The more aggressively the defender penetrates, the easier the trap block becomes.

## Blocking Assignments

Each position has a specific role in the Trap scheme. The center typically blocks back on the playside defensive tackle or nose guard, sealing the backside. The playside guard bypasses the targeted defender and climbs to the second level to block the playside linebacker. The playside tackle blocks his assignment, usually the defensive end or outside linebacker.

The backside guard is the trapper. He pulls across the formation, working behind the center and playside guard, and delivers the kick-out block on the unblocked defender. His path must be flat and quick, arriving at the point of attack before the defender can recognize the trap and adjust.

The backside tackle and tight end are responsible for sealing the backside of the play, preventing pursuit from the backside defenders.

## The Running Back's Role

The running back in the Trap play takes the handoff and aims for the gap created by the trapper's kick-out block. His initial path is typically toward the playside A or B gap, pressing the line of scrimmage and reading the trap block. If the trapper successfully kicks out the defender, the running back cuts inside the block and gets vertical. If the defender squeezes inside and closes the gap, the running back may need to bounce outside the trapper.

Patience and vision are critical. The running back must wait for the trap block to arrive before committing to a lane. Hitting the hole too early puts the back into an unblocked defender. Hitting it too late allows the pursuit to close.

## Why the Trap Is Effective

The Trap is uniquely effective against aggressive, upfield-charging defensive linemen. Modern defensive line play emphasizes penetration: getting into the backfield to disrupt the play before it develops. The Trap takes advantage of this aggression by using the defender's own momentum against him.

The Trap is also effective because it looks like a zone or stretch play in the initial moments after the snap. The offensive lineman who bypasses the unblocked defender appears to be executing a zone step, and the unblocked defender reads this as a run away from him, encouraging even more aggressive upfield pursuit.

Additionally, the pulling guard creates a numbers advantage at the point of attack. By bringing a blocker from the backside, the offense effectively adds an extra man at the running lane, outnumbering the defense at the critical point.

## Coaching Points

**For the trapper (pulling guard):** The pull must be flat and fast. The guard should take a short lateral step before driving across the formation, keeping his shoulders square and his pad level low. The kick-out block must be delivered with force, driving the defender out of the gap. If the trapper gets too deep in the backfield, the running back's lane disappears.

**For the lineman who bypasses the defender:** Selling the zone step is important. The lineman should take a lateral step as if blocking zone before climbing to the second level. This deception holds the linebacker in place, preventing him from reading the trap and filling the lane.

**For the running back:** Trust the trap. The back must be patient, wait for the kick-out block, and then hit the lane decisively. The best trap runners are physical backs who can make one cut and get north.

## Modern Applications

While the Trap is a classic play, it remains highly relevant in modern football. Many spread offenses use the Trap with the quarterback as the ball carrier, running it from shotgun or pistol formations. The addition of read elements, where the quarterback reads an unblocked end on the backside, creates an additional dimension.

The Trap is particularly effective as a change-of-pace play. After running zone or stretch plays for a series, the Trap catches the defense off guard by punishing the aggressive pursuit that zone runs encourage. It is also an excellent short-yardage call, as the pulling guard creates a reliable crease in a compressed field.
