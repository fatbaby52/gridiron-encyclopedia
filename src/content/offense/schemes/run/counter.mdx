## Overview

The counter run is a misdirection gap scheme that uses the running back's initial movement in one direction to freeze or displace linebackers before redirecting the play to the opposite side. It is one of the most effective constraint plays in football, punishing defenses that flow aggressively to the ball on zone and power runs.

At its core, counter is a power play with built-in deception. Like power, it creates a numbers advantage at the point of attack through kick-out and lead blocks. The difference is timing and misdirection: the running back takes a counter step away from the eventual point of attack, and two pulling linemen cross the formation to create the blocking at the hole. This momentary hesitation by the defense is often enough to spring a big play.

Counter is a staple of offenses at every level, from youth football to the NFL. It pairs perfectly with power, as the two plays look identical to the defense for the first fraction of a second before diverging in opposite directions.

## Execution

The play begins with the **playside linemen blocking down**, just as in power. The playside tackle, guard, and center seal their inside gaps, walling off defenders from the point of attack. This creates a clean lane for the pullers to work through.

The defining feature of counter is the **two pulling blockers**. In the traditional scheme, the backside guard and backside tackle both pull across the formation. The first puller—typically the guard in a **GT counter** (guard-tackle counter)—kicks out the playside defensive end, driving him toward the sideline. The second puller—the tackle—wraps through the hole and leads up to the playside linebacker at the second level.

The running back sells the misdirection with a **counter step**. He takes one or two steps away from the playside, as if the play is going in the opposite direction. This step is designed to move the linebackers laterally in the wrong direction. After the counter step, the back plants, redirects, and follows the second puller through the hole. The redirect must be sharp and decisive—there is no time for hesitation once the back turns toward the play.

The quarterback opens to the backside, executes the fake in that direction, and then hands to the running back as he redirects. In shotgun formations, the quarterback may take a slight jab step to the fake side before delivering the ball.

## Coaching Points

The **counter step** by the running back is the most critical detail. It must be convincing enough to move the linebackers but quick enough that the back does not fall behind the timing of the pulling blockers. Coaches teach the back to take one hard step away, then plant on the second step and redirect. The back's eyes should snap to the second puller as he redirects, picking up his lead blocker immediately.

The two pullers must work in sequence. The kick-out blocker must arrive first and establish the edge of the hole. The wrap blocker reads the kick-out as he comes through—if the defensive end is kicked out wide, the wrapper turns up tightly inside; if the end squeezes, the wrapper may need to bounce slightly wider. Communication and vision between the two pullers are essential.

Playside down blocks must be airtight. Because the pullers are coming from the backside, there is a moment when the playside gaps are vulnerable. If a playside lineman loses his down block, a defender can penetrate into the pulling lane and cause a pile-up in the backfield.

The backside of the line is left short-handed with two players pulling. The remaining backside lineman, along with the quarterback's fake, must account for any backside pursuit. Some schemes use a tight end or receiver to crack block the backside end, while others rely on the misdirection to hold that defender.

## Variations

**Counter Trey** is the classic version of the play, originating in the Washington Redskins offense of the 1980s and 1990s under Joe Gibbs. In this scheme, the backside guard and tackle pull, and the play is typically run from heavy personnel with an I-formation or offset fullback.

**GT Counter** (guard-tackle) is the modern terminology for the same concept. It specifies that the guard kicks out and the tackle wraps, which is the most common assignment. Some teams flip these roles depending on personnel and the specific front they face.

**Counter Read** adapts the play for spread offenses by adding a quarterback run-pass option. The quarterback reads the backside end—if the end stays home, the back gets the ball on the counter; if the end crashes, the quarterback keeps and runs or throws. This adaptation has become extremely popular at the college level.

**H-Counter** replaces one of the pulling linemen with an H-back or fullback. This can simplify assignments for the offensive line and allow the play to be run from formations that do not have a traditional tight end on the backside.

Some teams run **counter with a pulling center**, leaving the guard in place and pulling the center and backside tackle. This variation changes blocking angles and can be effective against specific defensive fronts.

## Level Differences

At the high school level, counter is taught as a direct complement to power. Teams that run power to the right will run counter to the left off the same initial action, creating a simple but effective two-play combination. The misdirection element is highly effective against aggressive high school linebackers who tend to fly toward the ball.

College offenses have embraced counter as a primary run concept, particularly in spread formations. Programs like Oklahoma under Lincoln Riley popularized counter schemes from four-wide receiver sets, using the running back's counter step and pulling linemen to generate explosive runs against light defensive boxes. The counter-read option adds another layer, making it a triple-option concept in some schemes.

In the NFL, counter is used as a change-of-pace and situational concept. Professional linebackers are disciplined enough that the misdirection alone is not sufficient—the blocking must be executed precisely. NFL teams often run counter in obvious rushing situations like short yardage and goal line, where the defense is selling out to stop the initial flow. It is also used as a constraint play to punish defenses that over-pursue on zone and power runs.

## Related Concepts

Counter is most closely related to power, as the two plays share playside blocking rules and differ only in the backside action and ball-carrier path. It also connects to trap schemes, which similarly exploit aggressive defensive movement. Together, power, counter, and trap form the foundation of a complete gap-scheme offense.
