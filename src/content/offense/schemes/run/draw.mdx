The Draw play is a misdirection run that disguises itself as a pass before handing the ball to the running back. By inviting the defense to rush the passer, the Draw uses the defenders' own aggression against them, creating running lanes as pass rushers charge upfield and out of their gaps. It is one of the most effective change-of-pace plays in football and a staple of late-down and passing situations.

## How the Draw Works

The Draw play begins with every appearance of a passing play. The quarterback takes a shotgun or under-center drop as if preparing to throw. The offensive line initially sets in pass protection, engaging the pass rushers and allowing them to push upfield. Receivers run routes downfield, pulling defensive backs into coverage and away from the line of scrimmage.

After a brief pause, the quarterback hands the ball to the running back, who has delayed in the backfield before taking the handoff. By this point, the defensive linemen have committed to their pass rush lanes, charging upfield and past the ball carrier. The offensive linemen redirect the pass rushers, turning their momentum against them and creating running lanes between the rushers.

The Draw is a delayed run play, and its timing is critical. The entire offense must sell the pass for at least one to two seconds before transitioning to the run. If the draw action begins too early, the defense reads it and fills the gaps. If it begins too late, the pass rush may overwhelm the quarterback before the handoff.

## Types of Draw Plays

**Standard Draw:** The most basic version. The quarterback takes a three-step or five-step drop and hands off to the running back, who takes the ball between the tackles. The offensive line redirects the pass rush and creates a lane.

**Delayed Draw:** A longer-developing version where the quarterback holds the ball for an extra beat, allowing the pass rush to commit even more fully upfield. This version is riskier because it gives the defense more time to read the play, but it creates bigger running lanes when executed properly.

**Quarterback Draw:** Instead of handing off, the quarterback keeps the ball and runs it himself. This is particularly effective with mobile quarterbacks who can make defenders miss in space. The quarterback draw has become increasingly common in modern football, especially in spread offenses where the quarterback is a threat to run.

**Inside Draw vs. Outside Draw:** The traditional draw hits the A or B gap between the tackles. Some offenses also run outside draws where the running back takes the handoff and bounces to the outside, using the pass rush's upfield momentum to create lanes on the edge.

## Why the Draw Is Effective

The Draw exploits the fundamental tension between rushing the passer and defending the run. Pass rushers are trained to get upfield as quickly as possible, using speed, power, and technique to pressure the quarterback. The Draw turns this aggression into a liability by letting the rushers run themselves out of the play.

The Draw is also effective because of its element of surprise. In obvious passing situations, such as second-and-long or third-and-medium, the defense expects a pass and aligns accordingly. Defensive backs drop into coverage, linebackers take pass drops, and the defensive line pins its ears back. The Draw catches the defense in these pass-oriented alignments and exploits the vacated areas near the line of scrimmage.

Additionally, the Draw benefits from the spacing created by spread formations. When the offense aligns with four or five receivers, the defense must match with defensive backs and linebackers in coverage, leaving fewer defenders in the box. The Draw exploits these light boxes by running the ball when the defense is least prepared to stop it.

## Coaching Points

**For the offensive line:** The sell is everything. Linemen must set in pass protection convincingly, engaging the rushers and mirroring their movements before transitioning to run blocking. The key technique is to allow the rusher to commit to his rush lane and then redirect him in that direction, widening the gap. The linemen should not fire off the ball aggressively, as this tips the play.

**For the quarterback:** The drop must look identical to a genuine pass drop. The quarterback should look downfield, sell the pass, and then smoothly hand the ball to the running back. In the shotgun, the quarterback may take a step or two backward before planting and giving the ball. The handoff should be clean and secure.

**For the running back:** Patience is the most critical trait for a draw runner. The back must delay his initial movement, standing in pass-protection posture or slowly drifting toward the line of scrimmage while the pass rush develops. Once he receives the ball, he must read the blocks and find the lane created by the redirected pass rushers. A decisive, one-cut style is most effective.

## Situational Value

The Draw is an outstanding call in several situations. On second-and-long, it catches the defense in pass mode and can produce a manageable third down. On third-and-medium, the quarterback draw can be a chain-mover, especially with a mobile quarterback. In two-minute situations, the Draw can catch an aggressive defense off guard, producing a big gain that changes field position.

The Draw is also one of the best complements to the passing game. By threatening to run the Draw, the offense forces defensive linemen to hesitate in their pass rush, giving the quarterback more time on genuine drop-back passes. This symbiotic relationship between the Draw and the passing game makes the Draw far more valuable than its statistics alone might suggest.
