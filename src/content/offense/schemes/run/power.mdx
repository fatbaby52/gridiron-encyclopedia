## Overview

Power is the quintessential gap-scheme run play and has been a staple of football playbooks for decades. The concept is straightforward: create a numbers advantage at the point of attack by using a lead blocker to kick out the defensive end and a pulling guard to lead through the hole. The running back follows these two blockers into the designed gap and runs downhill with authority.

Power embodies the philosophy that football is won at the line of scrimmage through physicality and leverage. While zone schemes ask runners to find the hole, power creates the hole through deliberate, assignment-based blocking. When executed correctly, it delivers the ball carrier into the second level with a head of steam and a clear path.

The play is sometimes called **power O** (the "O" referring to the offensive lineman pulling) or simply **gap power**. Regardless of terminology, the mechanics remain consistent across every level of football.

## Execution

The play begins with the **playside** offensive linemen blocking down—each man blocks the defender to his inside gap. The playside tackle blocks the three-technique or B-gap defender. The playside guard blocks the A-gap defender or the nose tackle. The center blocks back toward the backside A-gap. This down-blocking creates a wall on the playside and seals interior defenders away from the point of attack.

The **frontside kick-out block** is the first critical element. A fullback, H-back, or tight end is responsible for kicking out the defensive end or the C-gap defender. This blocker attacks the defender from the inside, driving him toward the sideline and creating a lane inside.

The **backside guard** pulls from his position, running behind the line of scrimmage toward the playside. He turns upfield through the hole created by the kick-out block and leads the running back into the second level. His job is to find and block the first defender who shows—typically the playside linebacker. This pull is the signature action of the power play and is what distinguishes it from other gap runs.

The running back takes a path behind the pulling guard, reading the kick-out block. If the kick-out blocker drives the defensive end outside, the back runs inside the block. If the end squeezes down inside the kick-out, the back bounces just outside. In either case, the back follows the pulling guard through the hole and gets vertical as quickly as possible.

The quarterback reverse-pivots or opens to the playside, hands the ball to the back, and then carries out a fake away from the play. In shotgun formations, the mesh mechanics change, but the blocking scheme remains identical.

## Coaching Points

The timing between the kick-out block and the pulling guard is the most important coaching detail. If the kick-out arrives late, the defensive end can crash inside and blow up the pulling guard's path. If the guard pulls too slowly, the hole closes before the back can get through. Coaches drill this timing relentlessly.

The pulling guard must have a flat pull path—running parallel to the line of scrimmage rather than drifting into the backfield. A deep pull path slows the play and allows linebackers to beat the guard to the point of attack. The guard's eyes should be up, reading the kick-out block as he approaches, so he can adjust his landmark.

The running back must display **patience and trust** in the scheme. Power is a downhill play, but the back cannot outrun his blockers. He should follow the guard's inside hip and be prepared to make one decisive cut—inside or outside the kick-out block—before accelerating through the hole.

Down blocks by the playside linemen must be secure. If a playside blocker misses his down block, a defender penetrates into the backfield and disrupts the pulling guard's path, collapsing the play before it can develop.

## Variations

**Power Read** (also called inverted veer) adapts the power concept for spread offenses. Instead of handing the ball to a running back heading to the playside, the quarterback reads the unblocked backside defensive end. The back takes a path toward the playside as a potential ball carrier, while the quarterback can keep and run to the backside if the end crashes toward the back. The pulling guard still leads, but the read element adds a dimension that defenses must account for.

**Dart** or **pin-and-pull power** replaces the traditional fullback kick-out with a playside lineman or tight end who pins the defensive end inside, while the pulling guard wraps outside. This variation is useful for teams that do not carry a fullback.

**Power from shotgun** has become increasingly common at all levels. The play loses the downhill momentum of a traditional I-formation power but gains versatility in formation and the ability to incorporate RPOs on the backside.

Some teams run **power with a lead tight end** instead of a fullback, using an in-line tight end to execute the kick-out block. This keeps the offense in heavier personnel without requiring a true fullback.

## Level Differences

At the high school level, power is often the bread-and-butter run play. Its clear assignments make it easy to teach, and it rewards physical, aggressive linemen. Many high school programs build their entire run game around power and counter from I-formation or wing-T sets.

College offenses have modernized power through spread formations and the power-read option. Programs like Ohio State and Alabama have used power-read as a foundational concept, leveraging athletic quarterbacks who can keep the ball on the read.

In the NFL, power remains a critical short-yardage and goal-line concept. Professional teams also use it as a change-of-pace run to complement their zone-heavy rushing attacks. The physicality of power can wear down a defense that has been flowing laterally on zone runs all game.

## Related Concepts

Power connects directly to counter, as both are gap schemes with pulling linemen. It also relates to trap, which exploits aggressive defenders using a similar kick-out technique. Understanding power is essential for any comprehensive study of gap-scheme football.
