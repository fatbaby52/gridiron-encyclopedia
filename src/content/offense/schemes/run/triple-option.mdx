The Triple Option is the ultimate expression of option football. It presents the defense with three potential ball carriers on a single play, forcing two defenders to be read rather than blocked. By leaving two defenders unblocked and reading their reactions, the offense gains the equivalent of two extra blockers, creating a numbers advantage that is extremely difficult to defend. The Triple Option is the signature play of the flexbone and wishbone offense families and has been used by military academies and option-based programs for decades.

## How the Triple Option Works

The Triple Option gives the quarterback three choices: hand the ball to the dive back up the middle, keep the ball and run off-tackle, or pitch the ball to the trailing pitch back outside. These three options are read sequentially, based on the reactions of two unblocked defenders.

At the snap, the offensive line blocks the interior defensive linemen, leaving two defenders unblocked: the dive key (typically the defensive tackle or end on the playside) and the pitch key (typically the outside linebacker or defensive end on the edge).

The quarterback takes the snap and immediately reads the dive key. If the dive key widens, stays in his gap, or moves upfield, the quarterback gives the ball to the dive back, who hits the A or B gap at full speed. If the dive key crashes inside to take away the dive, the quarterback pulls the ball and attacks outside.

After pulling the ball from the dive back, the quarterback turns his attention to the pitch key. If the pitch key attacks the quarterback, he pitches the ball to the trailing running back. If the pitch key stays wide to cover the pitch, the quarterback keeps and runs upfield between the dive hole and the pitch man.

## The Three Phases

**Phase One - The Dive:** This is the first option and the base of the play. The dive back hits the line of scrimmage quickly, attacking a gap that has been created by the offensive line's blocking scheme. The give to the dive back is the most common outcome and the bread-and-butter play of option offenses. It grinds out consistent yardage and wears down the interior defense.

**Phase Two - The Quarterback Keep:** If the dive key takes away the fullback, the quarterback pulls the ball and runs to the outside, attacking the space between the dive key and the pitch key. The quarterback must get outside quickly and attack the pitch key, forcing a decision.

**Phase Three - The Pitch:** If the pitch key attacks the quarterback, he delivers a quick pitch to the trailing back, who catches it in stride and turns upfield on the edge. The pitch is the most explosive phase of the Triple Option, as the running back receives the ball in space with momentum toward the sideline.

## Blocking Scheme

The Triple Option typically uses a veer or midline blocking scheme. The offensive line blocks the defenders they can account for, working combination blocks at the point of attack and climbing to the second level to block linebackers.

The two key defenders are left unblocked. This is the fundamental principle of option football: by reading defenders instead of blocking them, the offense frees up two blockers to work on other defenders. The result is a numbers advantage that makes the Triple Option very difficult to defend with standard defensive assignments.

The wide receivers and slot backs are responsible for blocking the perimeter defenders, including cornerbacks and safeties. These blocks are essential for the pitch phase, as the trailing back needs a lane to turn upfield after catching the pitch.

## Why the Triple Option Is Difficult to Defend

The Triple Option creates a mathematical problem for the defense. Two defenders are left unblocked but must still account for two of the three options. If the dive key does not take the dive, the fullback gains yardage through an undefended gap. If the pitch key does not take the quarterback, the quarterback runs free. If neither defender executes his assignment, the pitch man gets the ball in space.

The option also requires extraordinary discipline from every defender on the field. Each player must execute his specific responsibility without freelancing. If a linebacker jumps out of his gap to pursue the quarterback, the dive back runs through the vacated hole. If a safety triggers too aggressively, the pitch man runs past the secondary.

This discipline requirement is what makes the Triple Option so challenging to prepare for. Teams that face option offenses once or twice a year often struggle because their defenders are not accustomed to the specific techniques and responsibilities required.

## Coaching Points

**For the quarterback:** The quarterback must be a precise reader who executes his decisions with conviction. The dive read must be made quickly and decisively. If the read says give, the quarterback should seat the ball firmly in the dive back's belly and carry out a convincing fake. If the read says pull, the quarterback must smoothly extract the ball and immediately attack the pitch key.

**For the dive back:** Speed and courage define the dive back's role. He must hit the line at full speed, pressing the gap and being ready to take the ball on every play. His pad level must be low, and he must be prepared for immediate contact.

**For the pitch back:** Maintaining the proper pitch relationship is essential. The trailing back must keep the correct depth and width from the quarterback at all times, providing a clean target for the pitch. After catching the pitch, he must read the perimeter blocks and turn upfield.

## The Triple Option in Modern Football

While the Triple Option is primarily associated with service academies like Army, Navy, and Air Force, and with programs like Georgia Tech (historically), its principles influence many modern offenses. The Read Option and RPO concepts that dominate today's game are direct descendants of Triple Option principles: reading defenders rather than blocking them to create numbers advantages.

Some spread offenses have incorporated Triple Option principles by adding a bubble screen as the pitch phase, creating a modern version of the three-option play. Others use jet motion and read elements to replicate the Triple Option's effect with spread formations.

The Triple Option remains one of the most intellectually challenging and strategically rewarding plays in football. Its ability to create numbers advantages through disciplined reads makes it a timeless concept that continues to influence how the game is played.
