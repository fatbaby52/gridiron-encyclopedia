The Speed Option is an outside run play that combines option principles with perimeter speed. The quarterback attacks the edge of the defense at full speed, reading the unblocked pitch key defender to decide whether to keep the ball or pitch it to a trailing running back. Unlike the Read Option, which is built around an inside run, the Speed Option is designed to get the ball to the perimeter as fast as possible, threatening the defense with two ball carriers outside the tackle box.

## How the Speed Option Works

The Speed Option begins with the quarterback taking the snap and immediately sprinting toward the edge of the formation, typically aiming at the outside shoulder of the offensive tackle or tight end. The offensive line blocks down or zones away from the point of attack, sealing the inside defenders and creating a lane for the quarterback to get outside.

One defender on the edge, usually the defensive end or outside linebacker, is left unblocked. This is the pitch key. As the quarterback approaches this defender, he reads the defender's reaction. If the pitch key attacks the quarterback, the quarterback pitches the ball to the trailing running back, who catches it in stride and turns upfield. If the pitch key stays wide to cover the pitch man, the quarterback keeps the ball and turns upfield inside the defender.

The running back aligns behind the quarterback and takes a path approximately four to five yards behind and outside. This depth-and-spacing relationship is called the "pitch relationship" and is critical to the play's success. The back must maintain proper distance so that the pitch arrives cleanly and the defender cannot tackle both the quarterback and the pitch man.

## Blocking Scheme

The offensive line's job in the Speed Option is to secure the inside and give the quarterback a clean path to the edge. The playside linemen typically execute reach or zone blocks, working to get their heads playside of the defenders and sealing them inside. The playside guard and tackle must prevent any penetration that could disrupt the quarterback's path to the edge.

The backside linemen cut off pursuit, executing reach blocks or hinge blocks to keep backside defenders from chasing the play down from behind. The tight end, if present, either blocks down on the defensive end or bypasses him to block the next level, depending on the blocking scheme.

Wide receivers on the playside are responsible for blocking the cornerback and safety, creating a lane for the pitch man if the ball is pitched. These perimeter blocks are often the difference between a moderate gain and a big play.

## Why the Speed Option Is Effective

The Speed Option is effective because it forces the edge defender into a lose-lose situation. If the defender tackles the quarterback, the pitch man has the ball with blockers in front of him on the perimeter. If the defender covers the pitch man, the quarterback keeps and gains yardage inside. The defense cannot be right because the offense makes its decision after the defense commits.

The speed element adds another dimension. Unlike slower-developing option plays where the quarterback may need to pause and read, the Speed Option attacks at full sprint. The pitch key has very little time to diagnose the play and make the correct decision. The faster the quarterback can get to the edge, the more difficult the read becomes for the defender.

The Speed Option also forces the defense to be disciplined in its edge assignments. If the pitch key is slow, indecisive, or out of position, the quarterback can exploit the mistake immediately. This discipline requirement makes the Speed Option an effective constraint play that sets up inside runs and play-action passes.

## Coaching Points

**For the quarterback:** The quarterback must attack the pitch key aggressively, running directly at the defender's outside shoulder. He cannot slow down or hesitate; the speed of the play is its greatest asset. The pitch must be a firm, accurate underhand toss that leads the running back upfield. The quarterback should pitch the ball before contact, not during or after, to avoid fumbles.

**For the running back:** Maintaining the proper pitch relationship is the most important responsibility. The back must stay approximately four to five yards behind the quarterback and slightly outside. If the back gets too close, the defender can tackle both players. If the back gets too far away, the pitch becomes difficult and risky. The back must also be ready to catch the pitch and immediately turn upfield, as any hesitation allows the defense to close.

**For the offensive line:** Securing the inside is critical. If a defensive lineman penetrates and disrupts the quarterback's path, the play has no chance. The line must create a clean runway for the quarterback to reach the edge.

## The Pitch Relationship

The pitch relationship is the most fundamental concept in any option play, and it is especially important in the Speed Option. The trailing back must maintain consistent depth and width relative to the quarterback, creating a clean passing lane for the pitch.

If the back trails too closely, the pitch key can tackle the quarterback and still recover to make a play on the pitch man. If the back is too wide, the pitch must travel a long distance, increasing the risk of a bad exchange. If the back is too deep, the pitch takes too long to arrive, and the defense can pursue.

Coaches drill the pitch relationship extensively, using specific landmarks and spacing rules. The typical guideline is four yards deep and two yards outside, though this varies by system.

## Situational Use

The Speed Option is most effective against defenses that play aggressively on the edge or that struggle with option responsibilities. It is an excellent first-down call that gets the ball outside and creates big-play opportunities. It is also a strong answer to defenses that are loading the box to stop inside runs, as the Speed Option attacks the perimeter where the defense is thinnest.

In college football, the Speed Option is a core play for teams that run option-based offenses. In the NFL, it has been adapted for athletic quarterbacks who can threaten the edge, often used as a changeup within a broader spread or zone-based scheme. The Speed Option remains a timeless concept that rewards speed, decision-making, and disciplined execution.
