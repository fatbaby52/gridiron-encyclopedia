The Isolation play, universally known as the ISO, is one of the most straightforward and physical run plays in football. It is a gap-scheme play that sends a lead blocker, typically a fullback or H-back, through the hole to block the linebacker, while the offensive line handles the defensive linemen with one-on-one blocks. The ISO is designed to create a one-on-one matchup between the lead blocker and the linebacker, isolating the defender in space, and giving the running back a clean lane to run through.

## Blocking Scheme

The ISO is defined by its simplicity. Each offensive lineman is responsible for blocking the defensive lineman aligned over or nearest to him in a man-blocking scheme. There are no pulls, no combination blocks working to the second level, and no lateral movement. Each lineman fires off the ball and drives his man, creating a wall at the line of scrimmage.

The key block in the ISO is made by the fullback or lead blocker. He is assigned to the playside linebacker, typically the Mike or Will linebacker depending on the play direction. The lead blocker attacks through the designated gap, usually the A or B gap, and delivers a physical block on the linebacker. This block isolates the linebacker, hence the name of the play.

The running back follows the lead blocker through the gap, reading the fullback's block and cutting to daylight. If the fullback kicks the linebacker out, the back cuts inside. If the fullback drives the linebacker inside, the back bounces to the outside shoulder.

## The Fullback's Role

The fullback is the most important player in the ISO. His job is simple but demanding: hit the linebacker at full speed and move him out of the running lane. The fullback must have a clear aiming point, typically the inside shoulder of the playside linebacker, and he must attack that point with low pad level and explosive power.

The best ISO fullbacks are physical, fearless blockers who relish contact. They do not need to be fast or agile; they need to be willing to lower their shoulder and drive through a linebacker who is also attacking the line of scrimmage. The collision between the fullback and the linebacker is the defining moment of the play.

In modern football, the traditional fullback has become less common, but the ISO concept lives on. H-backs, tight ends, and even linebackers who have converted to offensive roles fill the lead-blocking position. Some spread offenses run the ISO with a running back as the lead blocker, aligning two backs in the backfield.

## Running Back Reads

The running back in the ISO has a relatively simple read. He takes the handoff and presses the line of scrimmage, following the path of the fullback. As he approaches the gap, he reads the fullback's block on the linebacker.

If the fullback drives the linebacker to the right, the running back cuts to the left of the block. If the fullback drives the linebacker to the left, the back cuts right. The key is to read the block and make one decisive cut. The ISO is not a play that rewards hesitation or multiple cuts. The back must trust his lead blocker, pick a lane, and attack it with authority.

The best ISO running backs are downhill, physical runners who can press the line, make one cut, and get into the secondary quickly. Speed and shiftiness are secondary to vision, decisiveness, and the ability to run through contact.

## Why the ISO Works

The ISO is effective because it creates favorable matchups at every level of the defense. At the line of scrimmage, the offensive linemen engage in one-on-one blocks where they have the advantage of knowing the snap count and the direction of the play. At the second level, the fullback has a full head of steam when he meets the linebacker, creating a physical mismatch in the lead blocker's favor.

The ISO also works because of its simplicity. There are no complex reads, no pulling linemen, and no misdirection. Every player knows exactly what to do, which means the play can be executed at full speed. In short-yardage and goal-line situations, this simplicity is particularly valuable, as the offense can line up and impose its will on the defense through pure physicality.

## Coaching Points

**For the offensive line:** Man-blocking fundamentals are essential. Each lineman must win his one-on-one matchup by getting off the ball first, maintaining low pad level, and driving his defender off the ball. If a defensive lineman penetrates the line, the running lane collapses.

**For the fullback:** Eyes and pad level determine success. The fullback must identify the linebacker quickly, accelerate through the gap, and strike with his inside shoulder, keeping his feet driving on contact. He cannot lunge or leave his feet; he must sustain the block to create a clear lane.

**For the running back:** The back must be patient enough to let the fullback's block develop but decisive enough to hit the lane at full speed once it opens. One cut and go north. Any lateral movement or dancing allows the defense to rally and close the lane.

## The ISO in Modern Football

While the ISO is associated with traditional, pro-style offenses, it has been adapted for modern schemes. Spread teams run ISO from shotgun with an H-back or sniffer back as the lead blocker. Some teams use the ISO as part of their quarterback run game, with the running back serving as the lead blocker for a QB keeper.

The ISO remains one of football's most reliable short-yardage plays and a staple of any offense that values physical, downhill running. Its simplicity makes it easy to install, and its effectiveness makes it a play that coaches return to when they need a tough, guaranteed yard.
