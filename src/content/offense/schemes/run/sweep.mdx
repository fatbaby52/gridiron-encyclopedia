The Sweep is a classic outside run play that aims to get the ball carrier to the edge of the defense with blockers leading the way. By pulling one or more offensive linemen to the outside and having them lead the running back around the corner, the Sweep creates a convoy of blockers that can overwhelm the defense at the point of attack. It is one of the most iconic plays in football history and remains a foundational concept in offenses at every level.

## Historical Roots

The Sweep is most famously associated with Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers of the 1960s. Lombardi's Power Sweep, which featured both guards pulling to the outside, became the signature play of a dynasty. Lombardi believed that if his team could execute the Sweep to perfection, the defense would have to over-commit to stopping it, opening up the rest of the playbook.

While the Sweep has evolved since Lombardi's era, the fundamental principle remains the same: get the ball outside with numbers and let the blockers clear the way.

## Blocking Scheme

The Sweep relies on pulling linemen to create a wall of blockers outside the tackle box. In the classic version, both guards pull to the playside. The playside guard turns upfield and kicks out the force defender, usually the cornerback or outside linebacker responsible for setting the edge. The backside guard leads through the hole, looking to block the first defender who shows up in the running lane.

The center is responsible for covering the backside A gap, and the backside tackle seals the backside edge. The playside tackle and tight end execute down blocks on the defensive end and inside linebacker, sealing the inside and creating a lane for the pulling guards to get outside.

In modern football, many offenses pull only one guard rather than two, simplifying the scheme while maintaining the core concept of getting a blocker to the outside. Some teams use a fullback or H-back as the lead blocker instead of, or in addition to, the pulling guard.

## The Running Back's Path

The running back takes the handoff and follows the pulling guard toward the sideline. His initial path is wide, aiming for a point outside the tight end. He must be patient and allow the blocks to set up before committing to a lane.

The key decision for the running back comes at the point of attack. If the kickout block by the lead puller is successful, the back turns upfield inside the block and accelerates through the hole. If the force defender squeezes the kickout block, the back bounces outside and tries to turn the corner. If the defense strings the play out to the sideline, the back must have the speed to outrun pursuit to the edge.

Great sweep runners combine patience with burst. They wait for their blockers, read the blocks, and then explode through the lane or around the corner.

## Why the Sweep Works

The Sweep is effective because it creates a numbers advantage at the point of attack. By pulling linemen from the backside, the offense brings extra blockers to the edge, outnumbering the defenders responsible for setting the edge and containing the run.

The play also stresses the defense horizontally. Defenders must chase the play across the formation, and any hesitation or missed assignment can result in a big gain. The Sweep forces the defense to be disciplined in its edge responsibility, which in turn opens up cutback lanes and play-action passes off the sweep action.

## Coaching Points

**For the pulling linemen:** Speed and angles are critical. The guards must clear the line of scrimmage quickly and get to the outside before the defense can react. The playside puller must identify the force defender and deliver a physical kick-out block. The backside puller must read the play as it develops and block the most dangerous defender in the lane.

**For the down blockers:** The success of the Sweep depends on sealing the inside. The playside tackle and tight end must execute their down blocks aggressively, preventing interior defenders from flowing outside and clogging the running lane.

**For the running back:** Patience is the most important attribute. The back cannot outrun his blockers. He must stay behind the wall, read the blocks, and make one decisive cut when the lane appears.

## Modern Variations

The Sweep has adapted to modern formations and schemes. In spread offenses, the Sweep is often run from shotgun with one pulling guard and a lead back or H-back. The wider splits of the spread formation give the pulling linemen more room to operate and force the defense to cover more ground.

Some teams use motion to create sweep action, bringing a receiver or H-back in motion across the formation before the snap. This pre-snap movement simulates the effect of a pulling lineman and can be combined with actual line pulls for an even more potent outside attack.

The jet sweep, which gives the ball to a receiver in motion rather than the running back, is a modern adaptation of the traditional Sweep concept. While the blocking may differ, the principle of getting the ball outside with speed and blockers remains the same.

The Sweep, in all its forms, continues to be a vital part of offensive football. It forces the defense to defend the entire width of the field, creates explosive play opportunities, and sets up complementary concepts through its aggressive outside action.
