# Shanahan Outside Zone System

The Shanahan system, carried forward by coaches like Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay, is one of the most influential offensive schemes in modern football. Rooted in Mike Shanahan's work with the Denver Broncos in the 1990s and refined by Alex Gibbs' zone-blocking techniques, the system combines an outside zone running game with a devastatingly effective play-action passing attack. Its core principle is deception: making every play look the same to the defense for as long as possible.

## Origins and Philosophy

Mike Shanahan built the Broncos' offense around the outside zone run. The concept requires all five offensive linemen to step in the same lateral direction, creating a wall of blockers moving toward the sideline. The running back aims for a point outside the tackle but reads the blocks as they develop, looking for a cutback lane when the defense overflows to the outside.

The genius of the system lies not just in the run itself but in what it sets up. Because the offensive line's initial movement looks identical on run and pass plays, play-action becomes extraordinarily effective. Linebackers and safeties who have been trained to read the linemen's steps are frozen by play-action fakes, opening up intermediate and deep passing windows.

Alex Gibbs, Shanahan's offensive line coach, was the architect of the blocking scheme. Gibbs demanded athletic, mobile linemen who could sustain blocks while moving laterally. He preferred smaller, quicker linemen over massive maulers, a preference that changed how the Broncos and their imitators evaluated and drafted offensive linemen.

## The Run Game

The outside zone is the system's foundational play. On an outside zone run, each offensive lineman takes a lateral step toward the play side, working in tandem with the lineman next to him. If a defender is in his gap, the lineman blocks him. If no defender is present, the lineman helps the adjacent lineman with a double team before climbing to the second level to block a linebacker.

The running back's aiming point is typically the outside hip of the tight end or tackle. As the back approaches the line of scrimmage, he reads the blocks from outside to inside. If the defense flows hard to the outside, the back cuts back against the grain, often finding a lane in the middle of the defense where a double team has created a crease.

Inside zone complements the outside zone by attacking between the tackles with the same lateral blocking steps but a different aiming point for the back. Together, inside and outside zone give the offense two primary run concepts that look similar at the snap but attack different parts of the defense.

## Bootleg and Play-Action

The bootleg is the system's signature play-action concept. After faking an outside zone run to one side, the quarterback rolls to the opposite side of the field. This puts the quarterback on the move with typically three route options: a deep crosser, an intermediate option, and a flat route. The boot works because the defense's linebackers and safeties have been conditioned to flow with the run action, leaving the backside of the field vulnerable.

The system's play-action concepts extend beyond the boot. Deeper shot plays off outside zone action attack the safeties, who are slow to recover to their deep responsibilities after biting on the run fake. The consistency of the backfield action across all of these plays is what makes the system so difficult to defend.

## Pre-Snap Motion and Misdirection

Kyle Shanahan, who inherited and refined his father's system, added extensive pre-snap motion to the scheme. Motion serves multiple purposes: it helps the quarterback identify coverage, creates blocking angles, and adds another layer of deception. The 49ers under Kyle Shanahan consistently rank among the NFL's leaders in pre-snap motion usage.

Jet sweeps, end-arounds, and trap plays complement the zone runs and add dimensions that prevent the defense from keying on a single concept. The Shanahan system's ability to generate explosive plays from seemingly conservative formations is one of its defining characteristics.

## Personnel and Formation Flexibility

The system is typically run from 11 personnel (one running back, one tight end, three wide receivers) and 21 personnel (one running back, two tight ends, two wide receivers). The use of fullbacks, which fell out of favor in many systems, has been a hallmark of the Shanahan approach. Kyle Shanahan's use of fullback Kyle Juszczyk as a lead blocker and receiver has demonstrated the position's value within the scheme.

Formations vary widely, from traditional under-center sets to shotgun and pistol looks. The system's versatility allows it to adapt to available personnel. Teams with elite running backs can lean on the ground game, while those with talented quarterbacks can emphasize the play-action passing attack.

## Modern Influence

The Shanahan system's influence on the modern NFL is vast. Sean McVay, who worked under Kyle Shanahan in Washington, brought the scheme to the Los Angeles Rams and won a Super Bowl. Matt LaFleur, Kevin O'Connell, and Mike McDaniel are among the many coaches who have adapted Shanahan system principles to their own rosters. The system's combination of simplicity in execution and complexity in appearance makes it one of the most effective and widely imitated offensive approaches in football today.
