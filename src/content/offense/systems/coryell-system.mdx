# Coryell Vertical Passing System

The Coryell system, also known as "Air Coryell," is one of the foundational offensive frameworks in football. Developed by Don Coryell during his coaching career at San Diego State and with the San Diego Chargers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, this system revolutionized the passing game by building the offense from the deep ball down rather than from the short ball up. Its numbered route tree, vertical stretching concepts, and emphasis on the tight end as a receiving weapon have influenced generations of coaches and remain central to many modern offenses.

## Don Coryell's Vision

Don Coryell was a coaching innovator long before he reached the NFL. At San Diego State, he built one of the most prolific offenses in college football, emphasizing the passing game at a time when most teams were run-first. When Coryell took over the San Diego Chargers in 1978, he brought his pass-first philosophy to the professional level and found the perfect quarterback to execute it in Dan Fouts.

Coryell's offensive philosophy was simple in principle: stretch the defense vertically to create space underneath. By threatening deep on every play, the offense forced safeties to respect the deep ball, which opened up intermediate routes for the tight end and underneath routes for running backs. The result was an offense that could attack at every level of the field.

## The Numbered Route Tree

The Coryell system's most enduring contribution to football is its numbered route tree. Each route a receiver can run is assigned a number from 0 to 9:

- **0 - Hitch**: Short stop route, receiver turns back to the quarterback
- **1 - Flat**: Quick route to the sideline
- **2 - Slant**: Sharp inside cut at a 45-degree angle
- **3 - Comeback**: Deep route with a break back toward the sideline
- **4 - Curl/Hook**: Medium-depth route with a turn back to the quarterback
- **5 - Out**: Sharp outside cut toward the sideline
- **6 - In/Dig**: Sharp inside cut across the middle
- **7 - Corner**: Route breaking toward the corner of the end zone
- **8 - Post**: Route breaking toward the goalpost
- **9 - Go/Fly**: Straight vertical route

Play calls in the Coryell system use these numbers to designate each receiver's route. A three-digit number assigns routes to the X, Y, and Z receivers respectively. For example, "586" would tell the X receiver to run an out, the Y receiver to run a post, and the Z receiver to run an in route. This numbering system provides a common language that is intuitive and efficient.

## Vertical Stretch Concepts

The foundational passing concepts in the Coryell system are built around vertical stretches. A vertical stretch places receivers at different depths along the same vertical line, forcing a single defender to choose which receiver to cover.

The **9 route (go route)** is the system's most important tool. By sending receivers deep on a regular basis, the offense forces safeties to play deep, which creates space in the intermediate zones. Even when the deep ball is not thrown, the threat of it opens up the rest of the offense.

The **post-corner and corner-post combinations** are signature Coryell concepts. These double-move routes exploit safeties who cheat on their initial read. A receiver who runs a post and then breaks to the corner catches a safety who committed to the inside, while a corner-post route exploits a safety who jumps the outside break.

## The Tight End as a Weapon

One of Coryell's most significant innovations was his use of the tight end as a primary receiving threat. Kellen Winslow, the Chargers' Hall of Fame tight end, was the prototype for the modern receiving tight end. Coryell aligned Winslow all over the formation, including in the slot and split wide, creating mismatches against linebackers and safeties.

Winslow's size, speed, and route-running ability made him a matchup nightmare in the intermediate zones that the Coryell system was designed to exploit. His impact demonstrated that the tight end could be more than a blocker and an occasional receiver; he could be the offense's most dangerous weapon. The modern tight ends who dominate the middle of the field owe a direct debt to Coryell's vision and Winslow's execution.

## The Coaching Tree

Coryell's coaching tree is extensive and influential. Joe Gibbs, who served as Coryell's offensive coordinator, won three Super Bowls with the Washington Redskins. Ernie Zampese, who succeeded Gibbs as offensive coordinator, further refined the system and passed it to Norv Turner. Turner brought the Coryell system to Dallas, where it helped the Cowboys win Super Bowls in the 1990s, and later to San Diego and other stops.

The Air Raid offense, developed by Hal Mumme and Mike Leach, borrowed heavily from Coryell's numbered route tree and vertical passing concepts. The spread offenses that dominate modern college football are, in many ways, descendants of Coryell's pass-first philosophy.

## Legacy

The Coryell system's influence on modern football is immeasurable. Its numbered route tree is the standard language of receiver routes across all levels of the sport. Its emphasis on vertical stretching and the tight end as a receiving weapon anticipated trends that would not fully arrive for decades. Don Coryell never won a Super Bowl, but his offensive innovations shaped the way football is played and coached to this day.
