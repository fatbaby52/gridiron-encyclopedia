# Erhardt-Perkins System

The Erhardt-Perkins system is one of the three major offensive nomenclature frameworks in professional football, alongside the West Coast and Coryell systems. Developed by Ron Erhardt and Ray Perkins during their time with the New England Patriots in the late 1970s and early 1980s, this system became the foundation of the Patriots' dynasty under Bill Belichick and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, and later Josh McDaniels. Its defining characteristic is a concept-based approach to play-calling that gives the offense remarkable flexibility and simplicity.

## Origins

Ron Erhardt served as offensive coordinator and head coach of the New England Patriots. Ray Perkins, who later became head coach of the New York Giants and Alabama, worked with Erhardt to develop an offensive language that was fundamentally different from the systems used by most other teams at the time.

The dominant systems of that era, including the West Coast Offense and the Coryell system, named plays by describing every player's assignment individually. A single play call might include a formation, a motion, a protection scheme, and individual route assignments for each receiver. While this approach was precise, it could also be verbose and slow to communicate in the huddle.

Erhardt and Perkins took a different approach. They grouped commonly used route combinations into single words or short phrases, which they called "concepts." Each concept described a pattern involving multiple receivers, and players knew their specific routes based on their position within the formation. This meant that the same concept word produced different individual routes depending on how the offense was aligned, but the overall structure of the play remained consistent.

## How Concept-Based Play-Calling Works

In the Erhardt-Perkins system, a play call might be as simple as a formation, a run or pass concept, and a protection. For example, a call like "Gun Trips Right 636 Tosser" would tell the offense the formation (Gun Trips Right), the protection (636), and the pass concept (Tosser). Every receiver on the field knows what "Tosser" means for their position in that formation.

The advantage of this approach is twofold. First, it speeds up communication. The quarterback can relay the play to the huddle quickly, and the no-huddle offense becomes easier to operate because the calls are shorter. Second, it allows the offense to run the same concept from many different formations without learning entirely new plays. When the formation changes, the individual routes adjust automatically because the concept is tied to the overall structure rather than to specific player assignments.

This flexibility made the system ideally suited to the New England Patriots' approach under Belichick, which emphasized weekly game-plan adaptations. The Patriots could install new formations and personnel groupings each week without overhauling their playbook because the underlying concepts remained the same.

## Key Concepts in the System

While the specific terminology varies from team to team, several passing concepts are commonly associated with the Erhardt-Perkins system.

**Tosser** is a deep passing concept featuring two vertical routes with underneath crossers to hold linebackers and open up the deep field.

**Hoss** combines a hitch route by the outside receiver with a seam route by the slot receiver, giving the quarterback a high-low read against Cover 2.

**Dante** is a deep crossing concept in which two receivers run deep crossers from opposite sides of the formation, creating natural picks against man coverage and flooding zones.

The run game in the Erhardt-Perkins system uses a similar concept-based approach. Run plays are given simple names that describe the blocking scheme and the back's aiming point. The system accommodates both gap and zone runs and can be adapted to feature whichever scheme best fits the team's personnel.

## Belichick and the Patriots Dynasty

The Erhardt-Perkins system reached its zenith under Bill Belichick. The Patriots' offense was famous for its ability to reinvent itself from week to week and even from season to season. With Tom Brady at quarterback, the Patriots ran a system that could be a power running attack one week and a spread passing offense the next, all within the same conceptual framework.

Charlie Weis and later Josh McDaniels refined the system, incorporating elements from other offensive philosophies while maintaining the concept-based structure. The Patriots' use of personnel groupings, formation variation, and pre-snap motion within the Erhardt-Perkins framework made their offense one of the most difficult to prepare for in NFL history.

## Influence and Legacy

The Erhardt-Perkins system's influence extends well beyond New England. Bill O'Brien, who served as the Patriots' offensive coordinator, brought the system to Penn State and later to the Houston Texans. Nick Saban, who worked with Belichick in Cleveland, incorporated elements of the system into Alabama's offense. Coaches throughout the NFL and college football have adopted the concept-based approach to play-calling, recognizing its efficiency and adaptability.

The system's greatest strength is its ability to reduce complexity for players while maintaining schematic diversity. By organizing the playbook around concepts rather than individual assignments, the Erhardt-Perkins system allows offenses to be multiple without being overwhelming, a quality that has made it one of the most enduring and widely used frameworks in football.
