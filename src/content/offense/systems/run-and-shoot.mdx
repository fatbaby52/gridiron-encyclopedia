# Run and Shoot Offense

The Run and Shoot is one of the most innovative and controversial offensive systems in football history. Developed by Glenn "Tiger" Ellison in the 1950s and refined by Darrel "Mouse" Davis in the 1960s and beyond, the Run and Shoot is a pass-first offense that relies on receivers and the quarterback reading the defense after the snap and adjusting routes in real time. At its peak, the system produced record-breaking offenses at both the college and professional levels. Though rarely used in its pure form today, its principles have been absorbed into modern offensive thinking.

## Origins and Development

Tiger Ellison, a high school coach in Ohio, developed the original Run and Shoot in the 1950s and described it in his 1965 book of the same name. Ellison's innovation was to create an offense that could adapt to the defense on every play without requiring an audible from the quarterback. Instead, receivers read the coverage and adjusted their routes accordingly, while the quarterback read the same keys and threw to the spot where the receiver would be.

Mouse Davis took Ellison's concepts and built them into a comprehensive offensive system. Davis implemented the Run and Shoot at Portland State University, where his teams broke numerous passing records. His quarterback, Neil Lomax, threw for over 100 touchdown passes in his college career. Davis later brought the system to the USFL and the NFL, serving as offensive coordinator for the Houston Oilers and Detroit Lions.

## Core Principles

The Run and Shoot is built on several fundamental principles that set it apart from other offensive systems.

**Four wide receivers.** The base formation features four wide receivers and one running back, with no tight end. This alignment spreads the defense across the field and creates favorable matchups for the receivers. The absence of a tight end means the offensive line must handle pass protection on its own, which places a premium on quarterback decision-making speed.

**Option routes.** The defining characteristic of the Run and Shoot is its use of option routes. Rather than running predetermined routes, receivers read the coverage during the play and adjust their paths accordingly. For example, a receiver might run a curl against zone coverage but convert the same route to a fade against press man coverage. The quarterback and receiver must make the same read simultaneously, requiring extensive practice and a shared understanding of the system.

**Receiver reads.** Each receiver in the Run and Shoot has a set of rules for reading the defense. The primary reads are typically based on the alignment and technique of the nearest defender. If the cornerback plays inside leverage, the receiver breaks outside. If the cornerback plays off, the receiver sits in the zone. These rules are simple in concept but demanding in execution, as both the receiver and quarterback must arrive at the same conclusion in real time.

**The running game.** Despite its name, the Run and Shoot does include a running component. The primary running play is the draw, which takes advantage of defensive backs dropping into coverage and defensive linemen rushing upfield. The system also uses the quarterback's mobility as a running threat. However, the running game in the Run and Shoot is a complement to the passing game rather than a foundation.

## The Run and Shoot in the NFL

The system reached its highest-profile implementation with the Houston Oilers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Under head coach Jack Pardee and offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride (with Mouse Davis having installed the system), quarterback Warren Moon led one of the most explosive offenses in NFL history. Moon threw for over 4,000 yards in consecutive seasons, and the Oilers' passing attack was one of the most feared in the league.

The Detroit Lions also ran the Run and Shoot under Wayne Fontes, with quarterback Rodney Peete and later Andre Ware. The Lions' version of the system featured Barry Sanders in the running back position, adding an element that pure Run and Shoot teams typically lacked.

However, the system's limitations became apparent in the postseason. Critics pointed to the Oilers' playoff struggles, including the infamous 35-3 collapse against the Buffalo Bills in the 1992 AFC Wild Card Game, as evidence that the Run and Shoot was too one-dimensional for the sport's highest stakes. The absence of a tight end made it difficult to run the ball in short-yardage and goal-line situations, and defenses eventually developed strategies to counter the option routes.

## Influence on Modern Football

While the pure Run and Shoot has largely disappeared, its concepts permeate modern offense. Option routes are now a standard part of every team's playbook. The choice route, in which a receiver reads the coverage and picks from a menu of options, is a direct descendant of Run and Shoot principles. The spread offense, with its emphasis on using four and five receiver sets to stretch the defense, owes a philosophical debt to the Run and Shoot.

June Jones, who played in and later coached the Run and Shoot, adapted the system for the modern game by adding tight ends and more diverse run concepts. His work at the University of Hawaii produced record-setting offenses and demonstrated that the Run and Shoot's core principles could be updated for a new era.

The Run and Shoot's greatest legacy is the idea that an offense can react to the defense in real time, turning every play into a collaborative decision between quarterback and receiver. This principle, once considered radical, is now fundamental to how football is played at every level.
