Trips — short for "triple" — refers to any offensive formation that places three receivers to one side of the field. It is one of the most commonly used alignments in modern football and creates a numerical advantage that forces defenses into difficult coverage decisions. Whether deployed from a traditional pro-style set or as part of a spread offense, the Trips formation is a foundational tool for attacking defenses through the air and, when used cleverly, on the ground.

## Basic Alignment

In a standard Trips set, two wide receivers and a slot receiver align to the same side of the formation, while a single receiver lines up on the opposite side. The quarterback can be under center or in the shotgun, and the remaining backfield players — typically one running back — fill out the formation.

The three-receiver side is called the "trips side" or "strong side" in this context, while the single-receiver side is the "weak side" or "isolated side." The specific spacing between the three receivers can vary based on scheme. Some offenses spread them evenly across the trips side, while others condense them closer to the formation or push the outermost receiver near the sideline.

Personnel groupings affect the look as well. A team in 11 personnel (one running back, one tight end, three wide receivers) might use the tight end as one of the three to the trips side, creating a different blocking and route-running dynamic than a pure three-receiver set.

## Defensive Challenges

The primary advantage of Trips is that it presents the defense with a numbers problem. Most defensive coverages are designed to balance defenders across the field, but when the offense loads one side with three pass catchers, the defense must choose how to respond.

In man coverage, the defense typically matches three defenders to the trips side, which can leave the single receiver in a pure one-on-one matchup on the weak side. This isolation is a deliberate design feature. Offenses can target their best receiver on the backside, knowing he will face single coverage with no safety help nearby.

Zone defenses face a different dilemma. If the defense plays a standard Cover 3, the cornerback and two underneath defenders on the trips side must account for three receivers who can distribute themselves across multiple zones. This creates natural voids in the coverage that well-designed route combinations can exploit. Cover 2 and Cover 4 shells must also adjust, often rotating a safety or walking a linebacker out to the trips side, which in turn weakens run support or opens up other areas of the field.

## Route Concepts From Trips

The beauty of the Trips formation is the sheer volume of route combinations it supports. Three receivers working together can create picks, rubs, high-low reads, and horizontal stretches that are extremely difficult to defend.

Common concepts include the "levels" concept, where the three receivers settle at three different depths — short, intermediate, and deep — forcing defenders to cover the full vertical range of the field. The "mesh" concept, where two receivers cross underneath at shallow depth, is also highly effective from Trips, as the natural traffic created by three routes in close proximity makes it hard for man-coverage defenders to stay attached.

Flood concepts send three receivers to different levels along the same sideline, creating a high-low-flat triangle that puts a single zone defender in an impossible bind. The sail concept and various screen packages also work beautifully out of Trips.

## Running Game Out of Trips

While Trips is primarily associated with the passing game, smart offensive coordinators use it to set up the run as well. Defenses that adjust to Trips by removing a defender from the box — pulling a safety over to help with the three-receiver side, for example — leave themselves vulnerable to inside runs. A team that establishes it can throw out of Trips will eventually find light boxes, and that is when the running back can do damage.

Jet sweeps and receiver screens to the trips side also function as extensions of the running game, using the natural spacing of the formation to create advantageous blocking angles.

## Strategic Considerations

Coaches must account for a few factors when using Trips. The formation can leave the offensive line exposed if the defense blitzes off the weak side, since there is only one receiver there to provide a quick throw outlet. The running back's pass-protection responsibilities become critical, as the formation's strength is built on having time to let the route combinations develop.

Additionally, the trips side can become congested. If routes are not spaced properly, receivers can bunch together and make life easier for zone defenders. Coaching precise spacing and timing is essential to making Trips effective.

Despite these considerations, the Trips formation remains one of the most versatile and dangerous alignments in football. Its ability to stress defenses horizontally and vertically, combined with the sheer number of concepts it supports, makes it a must-have in any modern playbook.
