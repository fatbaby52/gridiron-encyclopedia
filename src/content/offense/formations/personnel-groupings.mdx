## Overview

Personnel groupings are the foundation of offensive football strategy. Before a single play is called or a formation is set, the offense must decide which players will be on the field, and that decision dictates everything that follows. In modern football, personnel groupings are described using a two-digit numbering system that tells coaches, players, and analysts exactly how many running backs and tight ends are in the game. The first digit represents the number of running backs, and the second digit represents the number of tight ends. Since an offense always has five offensive linemen and one quarterback on the field, the remaining five spots are divided among running backs, tight ends, and wide receivers. The number of wide receivers is always implied: subtract the sum of the two personnel digits from five to get the receiver count. This simple system has become the universal language of offensive football, allowing teams to communicate their personnel intentions efficiently and enabling defenses to match with the appropriate defensive package.

## Alignment and Personnel

**11 Personnel** is the most commonly used grouping in modern football, featuring one running back, one tight end, and three wide receivers. This is the standard grouping for the majority of NFL and college offenses because it provides balance between the running and passing games. The three receivers create spacing, while the tight end adds a blocker and versatile route runner.

**12 Personnel** uses one running back, two tight ends, and two wide receivers. This grouping is popular for teams that want to maintain a physical running identity while still having viable passing options. The two tight ends can align in a variety of ways, including both on the line, one inline and one flexed, or in an unbalanced set.

**21 Personnel** features two running backs, one tight end, and two wide receivers. This is the classic I-Formation grouping, with a fullback and tailback in the backfield. It signals a run-heavy approach and is often used in short-yardage and goal-line situations. The extra back provides a lead blocker and additional pass protection.

**22 Personnel** is the heaviest standard grouping, with two running backs, two tight ends, and only one wide receiver. This is a clear power-running grouping used primarily near the goal line and in short-yardage situations. Defenses almost always respond with heavy fronts and stacked boxes when they see 22 personnel on the field.

**10 Personnel** puts one running back on the field with zero tight ends and four wide receivers. This is the most pass-oriented standard grouping and is the signature look of many spread and Air Raid offenses. It forces the defense into nickel or dime packages, creating favorable matchups for the offense in the running game against lighter defensive personnel.

**00 Personnel** is the most extreme grouping, featuring zero running backs, zero tight ends, and five wide receivers. This empty-backfield alignment is used almost exclusively in obvious passing situations. It maximizes the number of routes in the pattern and forces the defense to cover five eligible receivers, but it leaves the quarterback with no backfield protection help against the blitz.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

Each personnel grouping carries inherent strategic trade-offs. Heavier groupings like 22 and 21 personnel provide superior run blocking, better pass protection, and more physicality at the point of attack, but they limit the number of receivers and make the offense more predictable. Lighter groupings like 10 and 00 personnel spread the defense thin and create matchup advantages in the passing game, but they sacrifice blocking power and can leave the offense vulnerable in short-yardage situations.

The key strategic consideration is the defensive response each grouping triggers. When an offense sends 12 personnel onto the field, the defense typically matches with base defense, keeping linebackers on the field. This gives the offense the option to spread those linebackers out by flexing tight ends wide, creating mismatches in space. Conversely, when 10 personnel enters the game, defenses go to nickel or dime packages with extra defensive backs, which can create soft boxes for the running game. The chess match between offensive personnel and defensive substitution is one of the most fascinating strategic layers in football.

## Common Plays and Schemes

Personnel groupings directly influence the play calls available to the offense. In 11 personnel, the playbook is wide open: the offense can run inside zone, outside zone, gap schemes, play-action passes, dropback passes, screens, and RPOs. The versatility of 11 personnel is why it has become the default grouping. In 12 personnel, teams lean toward gap-scheme runs like Power and Counter, utilizing the extra tight end as an additional blocker at the point of attack, while play-action concepts off those run looks are especially effective. In 21 personnel, ISO, Power, and Counter are the foundational runs, with the fullback serving as the lead blocker. In 10 personnel, the offense typically runs zone concepts in the run game and quick passing concepts, screens, and vertical shots in the air attack. The 00 personnel grouping is almost exclusively a passing package, featuring five-man route combinations, hot routes against the blitz, and max-protection audibles when the defense brings extra pressure.

## Coaching Points

Coaches must be deliberate about personnel grouping selection because it sets the entire strategic framework for each possession. A well-designed game plan uses personnel groupings to create favorable matchups rather than simply defaulting to one look. Coaches should study how opposing defenses substitute in response to each grouping and identify mismatches that can be exploited. For example, if a defense keeps its base personnel on the field against 11 personnel, the offense can attack a linebacker in coverage with a slot receiver. If the defense goes to nickel against 11 personnel, the offense can run the ball against a lighter front.

Tempo is a critical component of personnel strategy. If the offense can operate quickly between plays, it can prevent the defense from substituting, effectively locking the defense into a personnel mismatch. Some coaches deliberately use tempo with heavier personnel to keep the defense in base when they want to spread the formation wide, or with lighter personnel to keep defensive backs on the field when they want to run the ball.

Communication between the coaching staff and the players on the field must be airtight. Personnel groupings must be signaled clearly, and players must know their alignment responsibilities for every formation the offense can set from that grouping. A single player lining up in the wrong spot can render the entire play design ineffective.

## Level Differences

At the **high school** level, personnel grouping strategy is often simplified. Many programs operate predominantly out of one grouping, typically 11 or 21 personnel, for the entire game. Limited roster depth means that coaches may not have the luxury of specialized packages. However, coaches who understand personnel strategy can still gain advantages by using formation shifts and motion to create different looks from the same grouping.

At the **college** level, personnel usage becomes more sophisticated. Teams carry larger rosters and have more specialized players, allowing offensive coordinators to employ multiple groupings within a single drive. College offenses often use personnel changes to dictate tempo and control the defensive substitution process. The rise of the spread has made 11 and 10 personnel the most popular college groupings, but innovative programs still find ways to deploy 12 and 21 personnel as change-of-pace packages.

At the **NFL** level, personnel strategy reaches its highest level of complexity. NFL teams use detailed analytics to determine which groupings give them the greatest statistical advantage against each opponent. Coordinators script the first fifteen to twenty plays with specific personnel groupings designed to test the defense and identify exploitable tendencies. The NFL's substitution rules and pace of play allow for more frequent personnel changes than college, making grouping strategy a critical element of game planning. Teams often carry players specifically designed for certain personnel packages, such as a blocking tight end for 12 personnel run schemes or a pass-catching back for 10 personnel spread sets.

## Related Concepts

Personnel groupings are the starting point for nearly every offensive concept in football. They connect directly to **formation design**, as each grouping can be deployed in multiple formations to create different looks and matchup problems. The **I-Formation** is the classic deployment of 21 personnel, while the **Shotgun** and **spread** formations are the natural homes for 11 and 10 personnel. Understanding personnel groupings is essential for grasping the strategic implications of **play calling**, **tempo**, and **game planning**. On the defensive side, personnel groupings trigger specific **defensive substitution** packages, making them the first piece of information a defensive coordinator processes when preparing for an opponent.
