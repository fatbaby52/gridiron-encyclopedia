The Under front is a four-man defensive line alignment within the 4-3 defensive structure where the defensive line shifts away from the call side, or toward the weak side of the offensive formation. This shift creates an asymmetric alignment that overloads the weak side of the line while creating space and one-on-one matchups on the strong side. The Under front is one of the two fundamental alignments in the 4-3 defense, paired with the Over front, and it has been a foundational concept in defensive football for decades.

## Alignment and Structure

In the Under front, the defensive line shifts one gap toward the weak side of the formation. The three-technique defensive tackle aligns on the inside shoulder of the weak-side guard, occupying the weak-side B gap. The nose tackle shifts to a one-technique, aligning on the weak-side shoulder of the center, controlling the weak-side A gap. The weak-side defensive end aligns in a five-technique, head-up on the weak-side offensive tackle.

The strong-side defensive end aligns wider, typically in a seven- or nine-technique, outside the tight end on the strong side. This places him in an edge-rushing or containment position.

The result is a defensive line that has three players concentrated on the weak side and one player on the strong-side edge. The strong side of the formation appears to have a numbers deficit along the line of scrimmage, which the Sam (strong-side) linebacker fills by aligning on or near the line of scrimmage as a de facto defensive lineman.

## The Sam Linebacker's Role

The Sam linebacker is the key to the Under front. By positioning himself on the line of scrimmage at the strong-side edge, typically outside the tight end or in a walk-up position, he creates a balanced look while maintaining the ability to drop into coverage or blitz. He is the swing player who transforms the Under front from a lopsided alignment into a versatile defensive structure.

In run defense, the Sam sets the strong-side edge. He is responsible for the C or D gap, forcing the running back to cut inside where the other defenders are waiting. Against the pass, the Sam can rush off the edge, drop into a flat zone, or carry the tight end in man coverage. His versatility is what makes the Under front effective.

The Sam must be a hybrid player: big enough to set the edge against tight ends and pulling guards, fast enough to cover in space, and aggressive enough to rush the passer. At the NFL level, this position often features players in the 240-to-255-pound range with the athleticism of a safety and the toughness of a linebacker.

## Run Defense Philosophy

The Under front is built for run defense on the weak side. With three linemen aligned to the weak side, the defense controls every weak-side gap. The nose tackle has the A gap, the three-technique has the B gap, and the defensive end has the C gap. The Will (weak-side) linebacker reads behind these three defenders and fills wherever the run goes.

On the strong side, the Sam and the strong-side defensive end handle the edge gaps, while the Mike (middle) linebacker fills the strong-side A and B gaps. The result is a defense that accounts for every gap without relying on secondary players to fill run-support roles.

The Under front is particularly effective against offenses that prefer to run to the weak side or that use zone-blocking schemes. The three-technique tackle disrupting the weak-side guard creates immediate problems for zone runs, as the double team cannot develop properly when the defender is already in the B gap.

## Pass Rush and Coverage

From a pass-rush perspective, the Under front creates a natural one-on-one matchup on the strong side. The strong-side defensive end, aligned wide in a seven- or nine-technique, faces only the offensive tackle. If the tight end releases into a route or chips and continues, the defensive end has a clean rush lane.

The three-technique tackle on the weak side is also a primary pass rusher. His alignment in the B gap gives him an inside rush lane against the guard, and his presence between the guard and tackle creates uncertainty about blocking assignments.

The Sam linebacker is a versatile pass-rush threat. He can rush from the edge, timing his move with the snap, or he can show blitz and drop into coverage, creating a simulated-pressure effect. His alignment on the line of scrimmage makes him a credible rusher every snap, which holds the tight end or running back in pass protection.

## The Under Front in Modern Football

The Under front remains one of the most widely used defensive alignments at every level. In the NFL, it is a staple of 4-3 defenses. Coaches like Pete Carroll built their Seattle Seahawks dynasty on an Under front with a dominant three-technique tackle (such as the role Brandon Mebane and later Jarran Reed filled) and an aggressive Sam linebacker.

In college football, the Under front is the base alignment for many programs. It is particularly popular in the SEC and Pac-12, where defensive coordinators face a mix of spread passing and physical running games. The Under front's versatility in handling both makes it a reliable base call.

At the high school level, the Under front is an excellent entry point for programs transitioning to a 4-3 defense. The alignment is straightforward, the gap assignments are clear, and the Sam linebacker role can be filled by the team's best all-around athlete.

## Coaching Considerations

The critical coaching point in the Under front is the Sam linebacker's technique and discipline. He must understand when to attack the line of scrimmage and when to drop into coverage. If the Sam is too aggressive, the strong-side flat opens up for quick passes. If he is too passive, the running game exploits the strong-side edge. Finding the right balance is the defensive coordinator's most important task when running the Under front.
