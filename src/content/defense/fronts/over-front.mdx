The Over front is a four-man defensive line alignment within the 4-3 defensive structure where the defensive line shifts toward the strength of the offensive formation. This shift places the three-technique defensive tackle on the strong side and the shade nose tackle on the strong side of the center, creating a loaded front that matches the offense's strength with the defense's mass. The Over front is the complementary alignment to the Under front and together they form the two pillars of the 4-3 defensive scheme.

## Alignment and Structure

In the Over front, the defensive line shifts one gap toward the strong side of the formation. The three-technique defensive tackle aligns on the inside shoulder of the strong-side guard, controlling the strong-side B gap. The nose tackle aligns in a one-technique on the strong-side shoulder of the center, responsible for the strong-side A gap. The strong-side defensive end aligns in a five-technique, head-up on the strong-side offensive tackle.

The weak-side defensive end aligns in a five- or wider technique on the weak-side offensive tackle. Unlike the Under front, where the strong-side end plays a wide edge-rush alignment, the Over front keeps both defensive ends in tighter alignments.

The result is a front that mirrors the offense's strength. Where the offense has its tight end, extra lineman, or additional personnel, the defense places its three-technique tackle and nose tackle to clog the gaps and prevent the run.

## Linebacker Alignment

The linebacker alignment in the Over front differs from the Under front. The Mike (middle) linebacker aligns behind the nose tackle, reading the offensive backfield through the A-gap window. The Will (weak-side) linebacker shifts toward the weak side, where he is responsible for the weak-side A and B gaps.

The Sam (strong-side) linebacker has more flexibility in the Over front than in the Under front. Because the defensive line is shifted toward the strong side, the Sam does not need to align on the line of scrimmage. He can play off the ball, giving him better angles for coverage drops and blitz timing. He typically aligns outside the strong-side defensive end, about three to four yards off the line, where he can set the edge against the run or drop into coverage against the pass.

This off-ball alignment for the Sam is a key distinction from the Under front. It changes the defense's pass-coverage capability on the strong side and affects how the defense handles tight ends and motions.

## Run Defense

The Over front is designed to stop the offense from running to its strength. By shifting the defensive line toward the strong side, the defense places its most physical players directly in the path of the offense's preferred running lanes. The three-technique tackle on the strong side disrupts inside zone and power runs by penetrating the B gap before the play develops. The nose tackle controls the A gap and prevents double teams from reaching the linebackers.

Against power and gap-scheme runs to the strong side, the Over front is particularly effective. The offensive line cannot generate movement against three defenders aligned directly in their path. Pulling guards run into occupied gaps, and the running back has no clean lane to the strong side.

The weak side is more vulnerable in the Over front. With only the weak-side defensive end and the Will linebacker responsible for the weak-side gaps, the defense is lighter in that area. Offenses that identify the Over front can audible to weak-side runs, attacking the less-defended side of the formation.

To counter this, the defense relies on the Will linebacker's speed and instincts. The Will must be fast enough to flow from his alignment to the weak-side gaps, filling runs before they develop. Safety rotation and secondary run support also compensate for the weak-side deficit.

## Pass Rush and Coverage

The Over front generates its pass rush primarily from the three-technique tackle and the two defensive ends. The three-technique tackle has an inside rush lane against the strong-side guard, using his alignment in the B gap to create leverage. The strong-side end rushes from the five-technique, and the weak-side end provides the opposite-side rush.

The Sam linebacker is the variable in the Over front's pass-rush scheme. From his off-ball alignment, the Sam can blitz from the edge, adding a fifth rusher without sacrificing coverage elsewhere. He can also feint a blitz and drop into coverage, creating confusion for the quarterback and the offensive line.

Coverage from the Over front benefits from having the Sam off the ball. With the Sam at depth, the defense has three linebackers available for zone drops or man-coverage assignments. This is more coverage-friendly than the Under front, where the Sam is typically on the line of scrimmage and less available for deep drops.

## Over Front vs. Under Front

The choice between Over and Under depends on the game situation, the opponent's tendencies, and the defensive personnel. The Over front is the preferred call when the defense wants to stop the run to the strong side. It is the more conservative alignment, matching strength with strength.

The Under front is the preferred call when the defense wants to create one-on-one pass-rush matchups on the strong side or when the opponent tends to run weak. The Under front is considered the more aggressive alignment because it creates an edge-rush threat on the strong side at the expense of strong-side interior numbers.

Many defenses alternate between Over and Under based on down and distance. On first and second down, the Over front provides strong run defense. On third down, the Under front creates pass-rush opportunities. This alternation keeps the offense guessing and prevents it from exploiting the tendencies of either front.

## Application Across Levels

The Over front is a staple at every level of football. In the NFL, it is the bread-and-butter alignment for 4-3 teams on early downs. In college, it is taught alongside the Under front as part of any 4-3 installation. At the high school level, the Over front is often the first alignment taught because its straightforward gap responsibilities make it easy for young players to learn.

The Over front's simplicity is its greatest strength. Every defender has a clearly defined gap, the alignment is easy to communicate, and the adjustments to different offensive formations are minimal. It is a reliable, repeatable structure that provides a sound foundation for any defensive game plan.
