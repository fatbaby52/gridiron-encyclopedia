# Tackling Fundamentals

Tackling is the most fundamental skill in defensive football. No matter how sophisticated a defensive scheme may be, it ultimately fails if defenders cannot bring down the ball carrier. Proper tackling technique maximizes the chance of stopping the play, minimizes the risk of injury to both players, and forms the foundation upon which all other defensive skills are built.

## The Evolution of Tackling Technique

Tackling technique has evolved significantly, particularly at the youth and high school levels. The traditional "head-across" tackle, where the defender drove his facemask into the ball carrier, has been replaced by safer techniques that emphasize shoulder contact, head-up positioning, and wrapping with the arms. Programs like Heads Up Football and the Seattle Seahawks' "Hawk Tackle" have promoted techniques that reduce head injuries while maintaining defensive effectiveness.

Modern tackling instruction emphasizes using the shoulder as the primary contact point, keeping the head to the side of the ball carrier rather than in front, and driving through the tackle with the legs.

## The Fundamental Tackle

### Approach

The tackle begins with the approach. The defender must close the distance to the ball carrier under control, with his feet active and his weight balanced. Running full speed at a ball carrier without control leads to missed tackles because the defender cannot adjust to cuts and changes of direction.

As the defender closes, he breaks down into a balanced position: feet shoulder-width apart, knees bent, hips sunk, and hands ready. This "breakdown" position allows the defender to move laterally, absorb contact, and explode into the tackle.

### Aiming Point

The traditional aiming point for a tackle is the ball carrier's midsection, specifically the area between the numbers and the hips. This target is the ball carrier's center of gravity, and contacting it gives the defender the best chance of stopping forward momentum.

Against larger ball carriers, the aiming point may shift lower, to the thighs. Against elusive runners, the defender may aim higher to secure the wrap before the ball carrier can spin or stiff-arm free.

### Contact and Wrap

At the moment of contact, the defender drives his shoulder into the aiming point while simultaneously wrapping his arms around the ball carrier. The wrap is critical. A shoulder hit without a wrap is a collision, not a tackle, and ball carriers at every level can run through collisions.

The arms should close around the ball carrier's body like a vise, with the hands clasping behind or around the ball carrier's frame. The grip should be tight and sustained, not a brief grab that the ball carrier can shake loose.

### Drive and Finish

After contact and wrap, the defender finishes the tackle by driving his legs and running through the ball carrier. The objective is to drive the ball carrier backward and to the ground. A defender who stops his feet at the point of contact relies entirely on his initial momentum, which is often insufficient against powerful runners.

Coaches describe the finish as "running your feet on contact." The legs continue churning, the hips stay engaged, and the defender works to take the ball carrier off his feet. The tackle is not complete until the ball carrier is on the ground and the whistle has blown.

## Types of Tackles

### Profile Tackle

The profile tackle, also called the shoulder tackle, is the modern standard. The defender makes contact with the near shoulder, keeping his head to the side of the ball carrier. This technique protects the defender's head and neck while delivering force through the shoulder girdle.

### Wrap Tackle

The wrap tackle emphasizes securing the ball carrier with both arms before worrying about driving him backward. This technique is used when the defender arrives at the ball carrier from the side or at an angle where a full shoulder strike is not possible. The priority is ensuring the ball carrier goes down.

### Swipe and Grab

In situations where the defender cannot get his body into a full tackling position, a desperation swipe at the ball carrier's legs or feet can bring him down. This is a last-resort technique, but it is better than a complete miss.

### Gang Tackling

While individual tackling is the foundation, football rewards gang tackling, where multiple defenders converge on the ball carrier simultaneously. The first defender secures the ball carrier, and subsequent defenders strip the ball, drive the pile backward, or simply ensure the tackle is completed.

## Common Mistakes

The most dangerous and frequent mistake is leading with the head, which risks catastrophic injury and is illegal in modern football. Lunging at the ball carrier instead of breaking down under control produces missed tackles. Arm tackling, reaching out to grab the ball carrier without using the body, allows strong runners to break free. And stopping the feet at contact gives the ball carrier a chance to fall forward for extra yards.

## Training Tackling

Tackling must be practiced daily, but the intensity and method of practice have changed. Many programs use tackling circuits with bags, sleds, and controlled live drills that develop proper technique without full-speed, full-contact collisions in every practice. The goal is to build muscle memory so that correct technique becomes automatic under game conditions.
