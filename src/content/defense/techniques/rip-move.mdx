# Rip Move

The rip move is a fundamental pass rush technique that attacks underneath the offensive blocker's hands rather than over the top. While the swim move works by clearing above the blocker's frame, the rip uses a violent upward motion through the blocker's armpit to gain separation and leverage. The rip move is especially effective for defensive ends and edge rushers who rely on speed and bend to turn the corner.

## Mechanics of the Rip Move

The rip move is built on a sequence of coordinated actions that must be executed with explosive timing.

### Approach and Setup

Like all effective pass rush moves, the rip begins with a purposeful approach. The rusher must threaten the blocker's outside shoulder to force a reaction. Most rip moves are initiated from a speed rush trajectory, where the rusher attacks upfield with maximum burst. This approach forces the offensive tackle to open his hips and kick-slide laterally, which exposes the inside gap beneath his arms.

The rusher aims his path just outside the blocker's frame, inviting the blocker to extend his hands to make contact. The moment the blocker commits his punch, the rusher executes the rip.

### The Rip Action

The rusher drives his inside arm, the arm closest to the blocker's body, upward in a violent ripping motion. The forearm and elbow punch through the gap between the blocker's arm and his torso, targeting the armpit area. This upward explosion lifts the blocker's arm and disrupts his hand placement.

The rip arm does not merely slide under the blocker. It attacks upward with force, driving through the contact point. Coaches often describe it as "punching the ceiling." The violence of this action is what separates a successful rip from a weak attempt that the blocker can easily smother.

### Shoulder Turn and Lean

As the rip arm drives upward, the rusher simultaneously turns his outside shoulder away from the blocker and leans his body into the rush. This combination of rotation and lean reduces the rusher's profile, making him a smaller target, while also converting his upfield momentum into a tight arc around the corner.

The shoulder turn is essential. Without it, the rusher's chest remains square to the blocker, giving the offensive lineman a broad target to re-engage. Turning the shoulder presents only the side of the rusher's body, making it far more difficult for the blocker to sustain contact.

### Bending the Arc

One of the most critical elements of the rip move is the ability to bend. After winning the edge with the rip, the rusher must flatten his path toward the quarterback. Elite edge rushers can dip their inside shoulder to near-ground level while maintaining full speed, curving their rush path from upfield to inside without losing momentum.

This bend is what prevents the quarterback from simply stepping up in the pocket. A rusher who wins the edge but runs a wide, looping arc creates a comfortable pocket for the passer. A rusher who bends tight after the rip collapses the pocket from the outside and forces an immediate disruption.

## When to Use the Rip Move

The rip move excels in several situations. It is most effective when the blocker sets deep and wide, trying to cut off the speed rush. The wider the blocker's base and the higher his hands, the more space exists underneath for the rip to operate.

The rip is also a natural counter to blockers who have adjusted to defend the swim move. If a blocker keeps his hands high to prevent the swim, his underbelly becomes exposed to the rip. This is why the best pass rushers pair the swim and rip as complementary techniques, using one to set up the other.

Speed rushers with exceptional flexibility and hip mobility gravitate toward the rip because it naturally flows with their arc-based rush style. The rip allows the rusher to maintain speed through the move rather than decelerating, which is sometimes necessary with power-based techniques.

## Common Mistakes

Young pass rushers often make the rip too passive, gently sliding their arm under the blocker rather than attacking upward. This allows the blocker to clamp down and trap the arm. Another frequent error is standing upright during the rip instead of dipping the shoulder and leaning into the rush. Without proper lean and bend, the rusher drifts too wide and the quarterback escapes.

Failing to set up the rip is another common issue. Throwing the rip without an initial speed threat makes the move predictable. The blocker can squat, narrow his base, and take away the underneath lane.

## The Rip in Modern Football

The rip move remains one of the most widely taught pass rush techniques at every level. Combined with the swim move, it forms the core of any defensive lineman's pass rush toolkit, providing a reliable method for defeating blocks and pressuring the quarterback.
