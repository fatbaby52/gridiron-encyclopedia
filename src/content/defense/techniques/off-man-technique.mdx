# Off-Man Coverage Technique

Off-man coverage is a man-to-man technique where the defensive back aligns several yards off the receiver rather than at the line of scrimmage. This cushion gives the defender time to read the receiver's route and react accordingly, trading the physical disruption of press coverage for the safety of depth and vision. Off-man is one of the most commonly used coverage techniques in football at every level.

## Alignment and Cushion

The off-man corner typically aligns five to eight yards from the receiver, though the exact distance depends on the game situation, the receiver's speed, and the defensive coordinator's preferences. The cushion serves as a buffer that prevents the receiver from running past the defender on a single move.

The cornerback aligns with inside leverage, positioning himself between the receiver and the middle of the field. This alignment takes away inside-breaking routes like slants and digs while funneling the receiver toward the sideline where the boundary provides additional coverage support.

The stance is a slightly staggered position with the weight balanced and the knees bent. Unlike press technique, the off-man corner does not need to be in an aggressive, forward-leaning stance because he is not initiating contact at the line.

## The Backpedal

The off-man corner begins the play in a backpedal, retreating from the receiver while maintaining his cushion. The backpedal keeps the corner's eyes on the receiver and allows him to process route information without turning his back to the play.

During the backpedal, the corner maintains a consistent cushion between himself and the approaching receiver. He does not want to let the receiver close the distance entirely, but he also cannot retreat so quickly that he opens up underneath routes for easy completions. Managing this cushion is the central challenge of off-man technique.

### Maintaining Leverage

While backpedaling, the corner must maintain his inside leverage. If the receiver takes an outside release, the corner allows it, staying inside and using the sideline as a boundary. If the receiver threatens inside, the corner must shuffle his feet to maintain position between the receiver and the middle of the field.

## Reading the Route

The advantage of off-man coverage is the ability to read the receiver's route as it develops. The corner watches the receiver's hips, feet, and body angle to identify the route before committing to a break.

### Speed Cut Recognition

Routes that involve sharp breaks, like the hitch, out, and slant, require the receiver to decelerate and plant. The off-man corner reads this deceleration as a signal that a break is coming and prepares to drive on the route.

### Rounded Route Recognition

Routes with rounded stems, like the corner route, post, and curl, show a gradual change of direction. The off-man corner reads the receiver's leaning body angle and hip turn to anticipate the direction of the break.

### Vertical Route Recognition

When the receiver continues to drive vertically without any break indicators, the corner must transition from his backpedal into a full sprint, turning and running with the receiver to prevent being beaten deep.

## Breaking on the Route

Once the corner identifies the route, he must break out of his backpedal and drive toward the receiver. This transition, called the "break," is the most critical moment in off-man technique. The quality of the break determines whether the corner arrives at the receiver in time to contest the catch or whether he is a step late and allows a completion.

### The Plant-and-Drive

On short routes like hitches and outs, the corner plants his back foot and drives forward toward the receiver's break point. The plant must be explosive, converting backward momentum into a forward burst. The corner aims to arrive at the receiver at the same time as the ball.

### The Flip-and-Run

On vertical routes, the corner cannot simply stop and turn. He must flip his hips, rotating 180 degrees into a sprint without losing speed. This hip flip is one of the most practiced movements for defensive backs, and its execution separates good off-man corners from great ones.

## Advantages of Off-Man Coverage

Off-man technique virtually eliminates the risk of being beaten on a single move at the line of scrimmage. The cushion provides a safety margin that allows the corner to recover from missteps and adjust to double moves. Off-man is also less physically demanding at the snap, allowing corners to conserve energy for the break and finish.

Against deep-threat receivers, off-man coverage ensures the corner is never caught flat-footed at the line of scrimmage. The depth provides a head start on vertical routes that press coverage does not offer.

## Disadvantages of Off-Man Coverage

The primary weakness of off-man is its vulnerability to short, quick routes. Slants, hitches, and quick outs are designed to exploit the cushion by catching the ball before the corner can close the distance. Offenses that face off-man coverage frequently attack underneath with quick-game concepts, accumulating short gains that move the chains.

Off-man also gives the receiver a free release, allowing him to run his route at full speed without physical disruption. The absence of a jam means the entire route tree is available to the receiver, and his timing with the quarterback is unimpeded.

## Situational Application

Off-man coverage is most commonly used in situations where the defense wants to prevent big plays. Late-game situations with a lead, third-and-long, and early downs where the defense wants to keep everything in front are all prime situations for off-man technique.
