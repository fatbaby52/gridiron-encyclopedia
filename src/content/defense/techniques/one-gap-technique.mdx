# One-Gap Technique

One-gap technique is a defensive line scheme in which each defender is assigned responsibility for a single gap along the line of scrimmage. The defender's job is to penetrate that gap at the snap, disrupting plays before they develop and creating negative plays in the backfield. This aggressive, attack-first philosophy produces a fast, disruptive front that can wreak havoc on offenses when executed properly.

## The One-Gap Philosophy

The fundamental philosophy behind one-gap defense is proactive disruption rather than reactive control. Where two-gap defenders engage blockers and wait for the play to declare, one-gap defenders fire into their assigned gap immediately, aiming to cross the line of scrimmage before the offensive line can establish its blocks.

This approach creates a faster, more explosive defensive front. Defenders aligned in one-gap assignments are typically lighter and quicker than their two-gap counterparts because the scheme values first-step quickness and penetration over size and anchoring ability.

## Alignment and Assignment

In a one-gap scheme, each defender aligns in a technique that gives him an advantage for penetrating his assigned gap. The alignment is typically shaded to one side of the offensive lineman rather than head-up.

For example, a three-technique defensive tackle aligns on the outside shoulder of the guard. His gap responsibility is the B gap between the guard and tackle. At the snap, he fires into the B gap with the intent to cross the line of scrimmage and disrupt whatever play develops behind it.

The key distinction from two-gap is specificity. The three-technique does not have to worry about the A gap on the other side of the guard. That gap belongs to another defender. This singular focus allows the three-technique to pin his ears back and attack.

## Technique and Execution

### Get-Off

The most important attribute for a one-gap defender is his get-off, the explosive first step at the snap. Because the defender is trying to penetrate his gap before the blocker can react, the speed of his initial movement is paramount. Film study of the opposing center's snap cadence and pre-snap tells helps the defender time his burst perfectly.

The first step should be a six-inch power step that drives the defender forward and low. A longer step overextends the defender's base and slows his second step.

### Hand Strike

As the defender fires into his gap, he delivers a sharp hand strike to the blocker on his path. The purpose is not to engage and control the blocker but to knock him off his blocking assignment and create a new line of scrimmage behind the original one. The hand strike is a quick, violent shot delivered while the feet continue driving forward.

### Penetration and Pursuit

Once across the line of scrimmage, the one-gap defender reads the play and pursues the ball carrier. If the play comes directly to his gap, he makes the tackle for a loss. If the play goes elsewhere, his penetration has still disrupted the blocking scheme by occupying linemen who were supposed to block at the second level.

The penetrating defender must maintain his rush lane and avoid overrunning the play. A defender who penetrates too deep can be run around, creating a cutback lane behind him.

## Advantages of One-Gap Defense

One-gap defense creates an aggressive, attacking front that generates pressure. The constant threat of penetration forces offensive linemen to block reactively rather than proactively, which disrupts the timing of running plays and pass protection alike.

One-gap schemes produce more tackles for loss and sacks than two-gap schemes because defenders are actively crossing the line of scrimmage. This disruption also creates negative plays that put offenses in unfavorable down-and-distance situations.

The scheme is also more forgiving in terms of personnel. Defenders do not need to be massive anchors; they need to be quick, explosive, and relentless. This opens the talent pool and allows coordinators to deploy smaller, faster players who might not survive in a two-gap system.

## Disadvantages of One-Gap Defense

The primary weakness of one-gap defense is vulnerability to misdirection and cutback runs. When a defender commits hard to his gap and the ball carrier cuts the opposite direction, the resulting running lane can be significant. Disciplined offensive lines and creative run schemes can exploit one-gap aggressiveness by creating false reads and trapping overaggressive defenders.

One-gap defense also places greater responsibility on linebackers. Because the defensive linemen are penetrating rather than occupying blockers, offensive linemen can more easily reach the second level and block linebackers. If the penetration does not produce a disruption, the defense may have defenders out of position with linebackers engaged by blockers.

## One-Gap in Modern Football

Many modern defenses use a hybrid approach, employing one-gap responsibilities for some defenders and two-gap responsibilities for others within the same play. This flexibility allows coordinators to tailor their defensive front to the specific threat an offense presents, combining the disruption of one-gap penetration with the gap integrity of two-gap control where needed.

The one-gap technique remains a staple of aggressive defensive schemes at every level of football, rewarding speed, effort, and controlled violence at the point of attack.
