# Edge Containment

Edge containment is a fundamental defensive concept that assigns responsibility for preventing ball carriers and quarterbacks from escaping to the outside. The player responsible for containment, typically the defensive end or outside linebacker, must maintain a position that forces the play back inside toward pursuing teammates. When containment breaks down, explosive plays follow because ball carriers who reach the edge face open field rather than a wall of defenders.

## The Purpose of Containment

Every defensive play is designed with lane integrity in mind. Interior defenders control the middle gaps while edge defenders serve as the boundary. Containment is not about making the tackle; it is about ensuring the ball carrier cannot get outside the defense's structure. A contain player functions like a wall, squeezing the play back toward the pursuit.

When a defensive end crashes inside on a run play and allows the ball carrier to bounce outside, the defense has lost its edge. The result is often a long gain because there is no one between the ball carrier and the sideline. This is why coaches emphasize containment discipline above almost everything else for edge defenders.

## Responsibilities of the Contain Player

The contain defender has several specific responsibilities depending on the play type.

### Against the Run

On running plays, the contain defender must set the edge. This means maintaining outside leverage on the blocker assigned to him, typically the tight end or offensive tackle, and not allowing himself to be sealed inside. Setting the edge forces the ball carrier to cut back toward the interior where the linebackers and interior linemen are pursuing.

The technique requires the defender to attack with his outside arm free, keeping his body positioned between the ball carrier and the sideline. If the blocker tries to drive the defender laterally, the contain player fights to maintain his ground rather than giving up outside position.

### Against Bootlegs and Rollouts

Containment takes on additional importance against play-action bootlegs and quarterback rollouts. When the quarterback fakes a handoff and rolls to the opposite side, the contain player on the rollout side is the first line of defense. If that defender has abandoned his edge to chase the initial run action, the quarterback has open space to throw or run.

### Against the Read Option

In modern spread offenses, edge containment is tested by the read option. The quarterback reads the contain player to decide whether to hand the ball off or keep it. A disciplined contain player does not commit to the running back, instead maintaining his assignment on the quarterback. This forces the give read and allows the inside defenders to tackle the running back.

Some defenses assign the contain player to "squeeze and slow play" the mesh point, keeping outside leverage on the quarterback while also discouraging the inside handoff. This technique requires patience and discipline that is difficult to coach.

## Techniques for Maintaining Containment

### Wrong Arm Technique

When a blocker, such as a fullback or pulling guard, attacks the edge, the contain player can use the wrong-arm technique. Instead of taking on the block with his outside arm, the defender attacks the blocker with his inside shoulder, spilling the play outside where the secondary and pursuit can make the tackle. This technique redirects the play rather than simply absorbing the block.

### Boxing the Blocker

Another approach is boxing the blocker, where the contain player attacks upfield and then squares his body to the line of scrimmage, creating a wall that prevents the ball carrier from turning the corner. Boxing requires the defender to maintain a wide base and keep his shoulders parallel to the sideline.

### Squeeze and Constrict

On some defenses, the contain player is asked to squeeze the edge, gradually tightening the running lane while maintaining outside leverage. This forces the ball carrier into an increasingly narrow corridor, buying time for pursuit to arrive.

## Containment in Different Defensive Schemes

Odd-front defenses typically assign containment to the defensive ends, who line up on the edge and have a natural position advantage. Even-front defenses may assign containment to outside linebackers who walk up to the line of scrimmage on the snap.

In both cases, the principle remains the same: someone must own the edge. The specific player varies by scheme, but the responsibility never disappears.

## The Cost of Lost Containment

When film study reveals a breakaway run to the outside, the first question coaches ask is: "Who had contain?" Lost containment is one of the most correctable and most costly mistakes in defensive football. Teaching edge discipline is a daily emphasis at every level of the game.
