# Bull Rush

The bull rush is the most direct and physically demanding pass rush technique in football. While finesse moves like the swim and rip rely on quickness and agility to evade blockers, the bull rush attacks the blocker head-on, using raw power, leverage, and relentless leg drive to push the offensive lineman backward into the quarterback's lap. A dominant bull rush collapses the pocket from the outside in, taking away the quarterback's escape lanes and forcing hurried decisions.

## Mechanics of the Bull Rush

The bull rush is built on leverage, hand placement, and sustained effort. Though it appears simple in concept, executing it at a high level requires refined technique.

### The Strike

The bull rush begins at the snap with an explosive first step and a violent hand strike. The rusher's hands must arrive before the blocker's. Winning the hands battle is the single most important factor in a successful bull rush because hand placement determines who controls the engagement.

The rusher drives both hands into the blocker's chest plate, targeting the area just below the shoulder pads. The thumbs point up and the heels of the hands dig into the breastplate of the blocker's pads. This placement allows the rusher to lock out his arms and convert his leg drive into forward push on the blocker's center of mass.

### Pad Level

The foundational principle of the bull rush is simple: low man wins. The rusher must play with his pads lower than the blocker's. A lower pad level creates an upward angle of force that lifts the blocker's chest and compromises his base. When a blocker gets elevated, his feet lose traction and his ability to anchor collapses.

Maintaining low pad level throughout the rush requires excellent core strength and hip flexibility. The rusher must bend at the knees and hips, keeping his back flat and his head up. Playing low is physically taxing, which is why conditioning is essential for bull rush specialists.

### Leg Drive

Hands and pad level create the initial advantage, but leg drive sustains the rush. The rusher must churn his feet in short, powerful steps, constantly driving his legs into the ground and generating forward momentum. The feet never stop moving during a bull rush. If the rusher's feet die, the blocker can re-anchor and the rush stalls.

Coaches describe the ideal leg action as "running through the blocker." Each step is aggressive and driving, as if the rusher is trying to sprint through a wall. The power comes from the ground up, through the legs, into the hips, through the locked-out arms, and into the blocker.

### Conversion

The bull rush does not always result in simply pushing the blocker into the quarterback. Elite pass rushers learn to convert the bull rush into a finishing move. Once the blocker's weight shifts backward and he begins to lose the battle, the rusher can execute a quick push-pull, shoving the blocker to one side and accelerating past him to the quarterback. This conversion catches the blocker off balance because he has committed his weight to absorbing forward pressure.

Another common conversion is the club-and-swim off the bull rush. After driving the blocker backward for several steps, the rusher clubs the blocker's inside hand down and swims over the top. The blocker, already leaning backward, has no ability to recover.

## When to Use the Bull Rush

The bull rush is effective in several situations. It is a natural choice when the pass rusher has a clear size and strength advantage over the blocker. Powerful defensive tackles use the bull rush as their primary weapon against smaller guards.

On long-yardage passing situations, the bull rush is effective because the offensive line is in a passive pass-protection mode. Blockers in these situations are coached to absorb contact and maintain position rather than punch aggressively, which makes them susceptible to a sustained power attack.

The bull rush also serves as a setup for other moves. When a blocker knows the bull rush is coming, he will sit heavier in his stance and anchor his base. This commitment to stopping the power rush makes him vulnerable to speed moves around the edge.

## Common Mistakes

The most frequent error is rushing with high pads. A rusher who stands upright during the bull rush gives the blocker the leverage advantage. Another mistake is punching with the hands but failing to sustain leg drive. The initial strike may jar the blocker, but without continuous push, the blocker recovers. Finally, some rushers attempt the bull rush from too far away, lunging at the blocker rather than engaging from a position of leverage.

## The Bull Rush as a Foundation

At every level of football, the bull rush remains the most fundamental pass rush technique. It demands no special agility or flexibility, only strength, leverage, and will. Building a dominant bull rush gives a defensive lineman a foundation upon which all other pass rush techniques become more effective.
