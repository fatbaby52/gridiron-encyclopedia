# Swim Move

The swim move is one of the most recognizable and effective pass rush techniques in football. Named for the over-the-top arm motion that resembles a freestyle swimming stroke, the swim move allows a defensive lineman to clear an offensive blocker's hands and gain inside leverage on his way to the quarterback. When executed properly, the swim move is nearly impossible to stop because it attacks above the blocker's hands and uses his own momentum against him.

## Mechanics of the Swim Move

The swim move is a multi-step technique that must be performed with precision and explosive timing.

### Setup and Approach

Before initiating the swim, the rusher needs to establish a threatening rush lane. Most effective swim moves begin with a speed rush approach or an initial jab step that forces the blocker to commit his hands in one direction. The setup is critical because a swim move thrown without context, with no initial threat to react to, is easily anticipated and defeated.

The rusher attacks on an angle that forces the blocker to extend his hands. An offensive lineman with fully extended arms is vulnerable because he has committed his weight and balance in one direction.

### The Club

The first physical action in the swim move is a violent club or swat with the inside hand. The rusher strikes the blocker's extended hand or forearm, knocking it downward and momentarily clearing a path over the top. This club must be sharp and forceful. A weak swipe allows the blocker to recover and re-establish his grip.

The club hand targets the blocker's wrist or the outside of his elbow, aiming to collapse the arm structure and create a gap between the blocker's hands and the rusher's body.

### The Swim

Immediately following the club, the rusher brings his outside arm up and over the blocker's shoulder in a sweeping arc. This is the signature motion of the technique. The arm drives up, over, and past the blocker in one fluid movement, pulling the rusher's body through the gap created by the initial club.

The key coaching point is that the swim arm does not merely wave over the blocker. It actively pulls the rusher's body forward and past the engagement point. The hand should land on the blocker's back or far shoulder, using it as a pivot point to accelerate past.

### Hip Clearance

As the swim arm crosses over, the rusher must turn his hips and clear his body past the blocker. This is where many young players fail. They execute the arm motion correctly but leave their hips square to the blocker, allowing the offensive lineman to recover and re-engage. The rusher must snap his hips perpendicular to the line of scrimmage, turning his body sideways to slice through the gap.

### Acceleration to the Quarterback

Once past the blocker, the rusher must flatten his path toward the quarterback. A common mistake is continuing upfield after the swim, which allows the quarterback to step up in the pocket. The rusher needs to redirect immediately, taking a direct angle to the passer's launch point.

## When to Use the Swim Move

The swim move is most effective in specific situations. It works best against blockers who punch high or extend their arms aggressively. When an offensive lineman shoots his hands to the rusher's chest or shoulders, the swim over the top exploits the space created by that extension.

The swim move is also effective as a counter. When a blocker has been beaten inside on previous rushes and begins to cheat his alignment to protect the inside gap, his outside hand becomes exposed. A quick swim over the outside shoulder capitalizes on this adjustment.

Down and distance also matters. On obvious passing downs, offensive linemen are in pass-set mode, often with wider bases and higher hand placement. These are prime opportunities for the swim.

## Common Mistakes

Several errors undermine the swim move's effectiveness. Reaching too early with the swim arm allows the blocker to duck under and re-anchor. Failing to club first turns the swim into an easily defended reaching motion. Not clearing the hips leaves the rusher tangled with the blocker. And forgetting to flatten the rush angle after winning gives the quarterback an escape route.

## Training the Swim Move

Coaches drill the swim move against bags, sleds, and live blockers. Repetition builds the muscle memory required to execute the club-and-swim sequence in a fraction of a second during a game. At every level from high school to the NFL, the swim move remains a foundational pass rush technique that every defensive lineman should master.
