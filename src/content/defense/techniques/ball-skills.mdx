# Ball Skills and Interceptions

Ball skills refer to a defensive back's ability to locate, track, and make plays on the football while it is in the air. This encompasses interceptions, pass breakups, and contested catches that defensive backs must win against receivers. Ball skills separate defensive backs who simply cover receivers from those who create turnovers, and turnovers are the single most impactful plays in football from a win-probability standpoint.

## The Importance of Ball Skills

A defensive back can play perfect coverage on every snap, but if he cannot make a play when the ball arrives, he is only half-effective. The best defensive backs combine tight coverage with the ability to intercept or deflect passes, creating a dual threat that makes quarterbacks hesitant to throw in their direction.

Turnovers change games. An interception not only ends the offensive drive but gives the opposing offense possession, often in favorable field position. Statistical analysis consistently shows that turnover differential is one of the strongest predictors of wins and losses at every level of football.

## Components of Ball Skills

### Ball Tracking

Ball tracking is the ability to locate the football in the air and judge its trajectory. This skill is partly natural and partly developed through practice. Defensive backs must transition from watching the receiver to finding the ball at the right moment, then adjusting their body position to make a play.

The timing of the transition from receiver to ball is crucial. Looking for the ball too early can cause the defender to lose track of the receiver. Looking too late means the ball arrives before the defender is prepared. The best defensive backs learn to read the receiver's eyes and body language to know when the ball is on its way, then find it in their field of vision.

### Hand-Eye Coordination

Catching the football requires the same hand-eye coordination that receivers develop. Defensive backs must be able to secure the ball cleanly, even in awkward body positions or while running at full speed in the opposite direction of the throw. Many defensive backs were receivers at earlier stages of their careers, which contributes to their ball skills.

### Body Positioning

Making a play on the ball often requires the defensive back to position his body between the receiver and the football. This "playing through the receiver's hands" technique puts the defender in the best position to intercept the pass while also preventing the receiver from making the catch.

When the ball is thrown to the defender's side, he can attack the ball directly. When the ball is thrown to the receiver's opposite side, the defender must work through or around the receiver's body to make a play, which is more difficult but still possible with proper technique.

## Interception Technique

### High-Point Interceptions

The high-point interception involves jumping to catch the ball at its highest point before it descends to the receiver. This technique is used on deep throws and fade routes where the ball arrives on a descending arc. The defender times his jump to meet the ball at its peak, using his height and leaping ability to secure it above the receiver.

### Undercutting Routes

When a defensive back reads a short or intermediate route, he can undercut the route by driving in front of the receiver to intercept the pass. Undercutting requires confidence in the read because a wrong guess leaves the defender completely out of position. The defender must be certain of the route and the throw before committing to the undercut.

### Catch Technique

Defensive backs are taught to catch the ball with their hands, not their body. Hands catch, also called "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" depending on the ball's trajectory, gives the defender the best chance of securing the interception. For balls arriving above the waist, the thumbs point inward. For balls arriving below the waist, the pinkies point inward and the hands form a basket.

After securing the interception, the defender must immediately become a ball carrier, protecting the football and looking upfield for return yardage.

## Pass Breakup Technique

Not every play on the ball results in an interception. Pass breakups, where the defender deflects the ball to prevent a completion, are equally valuable.

### The Rake

The rake technique involves the defender swinging his near arm through the receiver's hands at the moment the ball arrives, dislodging it before the receiver can secure the catch. The motion is a downward swipe through the catching triangle formed by the receiver's hands.

### The Punch

The punch is a targeted strike at the ball itself as it arrives in the receiver's hands. The defender jabs his fist or open hand at the point of the ball, knocking it loose. This technique is effective in contested catch situations where the defender is in close proximity to the receiver.

### Playing the Upfield Arm

When trailing a receiver in man coverage, the defender can use his upfield arm, the arm closest to the ball, to reach through and disrupt the catch. This technique allows the defender to make a play on the ball without committing a pass interference penalty, as long as the contact is with the ball rather than the receiver's body.

## Developing Ball Skills

### Jugs Machine and Tennis Ball Drills

Defensive backs develop tracking and catching ability with repetitive drills using jugs machines and tennis balls. These drills improve hand-eye coordination and the ability to catch balls from various angles and speeds.

### Turnover Circuits

Many teams run daily turnover circuits in practice, where defensive backs practice interception technique, strip drills, and fumble recovery. The emphasis on turnovers in practice creates a mentality that carries over to games.

## The Playmaker Mentality

Ball skills are ultimately about mentality as much as technique. Defensive backs who believe they are receivers on defense, who expect the ball to come their way and are prepared to catch it, generate more turnovers than those who play passively. Coaches cultivate this mindset by celebrating turnovers in practice and holding defensive backs to the same catching standards as receivers.
