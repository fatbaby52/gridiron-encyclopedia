# Run Fit and Fill

Run fit and fill describes the linebacker's responsibility to identify his assigned gap in the run defense structure and physically fill that gap at the point of attack. While the defensive line creates the initial wall along the line of scrimmage, linebackers serve as the second level of defense, plugging gaps that open and tackling ball carriers who penetrate the front. Proper fit and fill technique is the backbone of second-level run defense.

## The Concept of Fitting and Filling

Every defensive play call assigns each linebacker a specific gap to defend against the run. The "fit" is the gap assignment itself, and the "fill" is the physical act of occupying that gap at full speed when the ball carrier approaches. The linebacker must read his keys, identify the point of attack, and attack his gap with aggression and proper technique.

The linebacker's gap assignment is determined by the defensive call, the offensive formation, and the blocking scheme he reads after the snap. Different run plays require different responses, but the principle remains constant: find your gap, fill your gap, and make the tackle.

## Pre-Snap Reads

Before the snap, the linebacker begins gathering information that will help him execute his run fit. He notes the offensive formation, the alignment of the tight end, the position of the running back, and any pre-snap motion. These clues help narrow the range of possible run plays.

The linebacker also communicates with the defensive line, confirming gap responsibilities and alerting teammates to formation adjustments. This communication ensures that every gap is accounted for and no seam exists for the ball carrier to exploit.

## Post-Snap Keys

At the snap, the linebacker reads his keys to determine whether the play is a run or pass and, if a run, where it is directed.

### First Key: Offensive Line

The movement of the offensive linemen is the linebacker's primary indicator. Linemen firing forward in unison signal a run play. The direction of their movement indicates the direction of the run. Zone-blocking footwork, with linemen stepping laterally in combination, tells the linebacker to prepare for a zone run. Down blocks and pulling linemen indicate gap-scheme runs like power, counter, or trap.

### Second Key: Running Back

The running back's path confirms the read from the offensive line. The linebacker must track the back's aiming point to anticipate where the ball will arrive at the line of scrimmage. Against zone runs, the back may press one gap before cutting to another, so the linebacker must be patient and not overcommit to the initial flow.

### Third Key: The Ball

Ultimately, the linebacker must find the ball and attack it. After processing his lineman and backfield keys, the linebacker locates the ball carrier and drives to his gap.

## Filling the Gap

Once the linebacker has identified the point of attack, he must fill his gap with authority. This means attacking downhill, toward the line of scrimmage, with his shoulders square and his pads low. A linebacker who drifts laterally instead of attacking downhill gives the ball carrier time and space to find a crease.

### Taking on Blocks

Linebackers rarely have a clean, unblocked path to the ball carrier. Fullbacks, pulling guards, and second-level blocks from offensive linemen all obstruct the linebacker's path to his gap. The linebacker must defeat these blocks while maintaining his gap integrity.

The technique for taking on a block at the second level involves striking the blocker with the same-side shoulder and arm as the gap the linebacker is filling. This keeps the opposite arm free to shed the block and make the tackle. If the linebacker is filling the B gap to his right, he strikes the blocker with his right shoulder, keeping his left arm free to disengage.

### Spilling and Squeezing

Depending on the defensive scheme, the linebacker may be coached to spill or squeeze at the point of attack. Spilling means attacking the inside shoulder of the kick-out blocker, forcing the ball carrier to bounce outside where pursuit and the contain player are waiting. Squeezing means taking on the blocker's outside shoulder, constricting the gap and forcing the ball carrier to cut back inside toward interior pursuit.

The choice between spilling and squeezing depends on the defensive coordinator's philosophy and the specific play being defended.

## Common Mistakes

Several errors undermine a linebacker's run fit effectiveness. False steps, stepping in the wrong direction initially, waste time and create separation between the linebacker and the ball carrier. Overreading, committing too quickly to an initial flow direction, makes the linebacker vulnerable to misdirection plays like counters and reverses.

Running around blocks instead of taking them on allows offensive linemen to wall off the linebacker from his gap. And failing to attack downhill, playing laterally instead of aggressively filling, turns the linebacker into a passive observer rather than an active tackler.

## The Discipline of Fit and Fill

Run fit and fill requires the same disciplined, selfless approach every play. The linebacker who fills his gap correctly on a play that goes elsewhere does not appear on the highlight reel, but he is the reason the defense has structural integrity. Consistent gap discipline across all eleven defenders is what separates elite run defenses from average ones.
