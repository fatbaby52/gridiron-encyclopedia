# Pursuit Angles

Pursuit angles are the paths defenders take to intercept a ball carrier who is moving laterally or downfield. The correct pursuit angle allows a defender to arrive at the ball carrier's projected location at the same time as the ball carrier, even if the defender is not as fast. Poor pursuit angles result in missed tackles, long runs, and broken plays that demoralize an entire defense. Mastering pursuit is one of the most important fundamentals in football.

## The Geometry of Pursuit

Pursuit angles are fundamentally a geometry problem. A defender starting from one point on the field must reach a ball carrier moving from another point. If the defender runs directly at the ball carrier's current position, the ball carrier will have moved by the time the defender arrives. The defender must instead aim for where the ball carrier will be, taking an angle that accounts for both players' speed and direction.

The faster the ball carrier, the flatter the pursuit angle must be. A defender chasing a fast ball carrier moving horizontally must take a path that runs nearly parallel to the line of scrimmage, aiming for a point well ahead of the ball carrier. Against a slower ball carrier, the defender can take a steeper angle, attacking more directly toward the current position.

## Types of Pursuit Angles

### Inside-Out Pursuit

The most common pursuit angle is inside-out, where the defender approaches the ball carrier from the inside of the field toward the sideline. This angle allows the defender to force the ball carrier toward the boundary, where the sideline acts as an extra defender. Inside-out pursuit also prevents the ball carrier from cutting back inside, where more open space typically exists.

Inside-out is the default pursuit angle for most defenders because it addresses the most common running plays, which attack from the interior toward the outside.

### Outside-In Pursuit

Outside-in pursuit occurs when a defender approaches the ball carrier from the outside, typically on plays that cut back against the original flow. Backside defenders who read the cutback must take an outside-in angle to meet the ball carrier at the new point of attack. This angle requires the defender to recognize the cutback quickly and adjust his path.

### Alley Pursuit

Alley pursuit refers to the path a defender takes through a specific lane or alley between other defenders. Safeties and outside linebackers often have alley responsibilities, filling a specific running lane from depth. The alley is the gap between the defensive end and the cornerback, and the defender must fill it at the correct angle to prevent the ball carrier from splitting through.

### Deep Pursuit

Deep pursuit, sometimes called the "chase" angle, is the path taken by defenders who are far from the point of attack. These defenders take a deep angle, running behind the play toward the end zone, positioning themselves as the last line of defense. The deep pursuit angle aims for a point roughly 5 yards behind the ball carrier, ensuring the defender can adjust to cuts and changes of direction.

## Coaching Pursuit Angles

### The Intersection Principle

Coaches teach pursuit using the intersection principle: the defender should run to the point where his path and the ball carrier's path intersect. This requires the defender to constantly evaluate the ball carrier's speed and direction and adjust his own path accordingly.

### Practice Drills

Pursuit drills are a staple of defensive practice. The most common drill has the offense run a sweep while every defender sprints to the ball, each taking the appropriate angle based on his starting position. Coaches evaluate each defender's path from behind, checking that angles are correct and effort is maximum.

Another popular drill is the sideline pursuit drill, where a ball carrier runs along the sideline and defenders from various depths and distances must take proper angles to intercept him. This drill teaches defenders to judge speed and distance in a controlled setting.

### Effort and Finish

No pursuit angle matters if the defender does not run full speed. Pursuit is as much about effort as technique. The best defensive teams are distinguished by eleven players sprinting to the ball on every play, each taking the correct angle. Coaches emphasize that the play is not over until the whistle blows, and every defender must pursue as if he will be the one making the tackle.

Plays that appear dead often produce big gains when the defense relaxes. A ball carrier who breaks one tackle can gain 20 additional yards if the remaining defenders have stopped pursuing.

## Common Mistakes

The most frequent pursuit error is overrunning the ball carrier, taking too flat an angle and allowing the ball carrier to cut underneath. The defender arrives at the projected intersection point, but the ball carrier has already turned upfield behind him. This mistake is especially common against shifty runners who can change direction quickly.

The opposite error, taking too steep an angle, allows the ball carrier to outrun the defender to the sideline. This typically occurs when a slow defender tries to take a direct path to a fast ball carrier instead of computing a flatter angle.

Another common mistake is pursuing the ball carrier's current position rather than his projected position. This results in a perpetual chase where the defender is always one step behind, never quite able to close the gap.

## Pursuit as a Team Concept

Individual pursuit angles are important, but pursuit is ultimately a team concept. When all eleven defenders take correct angles at full speed, the defense creates a net that the ball carrier cannot escape. This collective effort is what coaches mean when they talk about "swarming to the ball." It is the hallmark of a disciplined, well-coached defense.
