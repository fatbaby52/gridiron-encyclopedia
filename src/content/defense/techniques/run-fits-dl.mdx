# Defensive Line Run Fits

Run fits describe the coordinated gap assignments that defensive players execute against the run. For the defensive line, proper run fits mean each defender controls his designated gap, creating a seamless wall across the front that leaves no running lanes for the ball carrier. When every defender fits his gap correctly, the offense has no clean path forward. When even one defender misses his fit, the result is often a significant gain.

## Understanding Gaps and Fits

The offensive line creates gaps between each lineman. These gaps are labeled with letters starting from the center: A gaps are immediately beside the center, B gaps sit between the guards and tackles, and C gaps are outside the tackles. The D gap extends beyond the tight end.

A defensive run fit is the specific gap a defender is assigned to fill on a given play. The fit depends on the defensive front, the play called, and the offensive formation. Every defender has a gap, and every gap must have a defender. This mathematical accounting is the foundation of run defense.

## The Defensive Lineman's Role in Run Fits

Defensive linemen are the first line of run defense. Their fit assignments determine where they must be at the moment the ball carrier reaches the line of scrimmage. A defensive lineman who executes his run fit correctly takes away one running lane, forcing the ball carrier to redirect into the arms of pursuing linebackers and safeties.

### Identifying the Fit

Before the snap, each defensive lineman must understand his gap responsibility based on the defensive call. In a one-gap scheme, the assignment is straightforward: the defender penetrates his designated gap. In a two-gap scheme, the defender controls the blocker in front of him and reacts to whichever gap the ball carrier targets.

Some defensive calls shift gap responsibilities based on offensive strength, formation, or motion. A defensive lineman must process this information quickly and align accordingly.

### Playing the Fit Versus the Block

The offensive blocking scheme directly influences how a defensive lineman executes his run fit. Different blocks require different responses.

**Down blocks**: When the offensive lineman blocks down, away from the defender, the defender must squeeze the block and look for the puller or kick-out block coming from the outside. Squeezing means following the down block inward to close the gap rather than allowing it to open.

**Base blocks**: A straight-ahead drive block requires the defender to hold his ground in his gap, using hand placement and leverage to maintain position. The defender anchors, locates the ball, and sheds the block to make the tackle.

**Double teams**: When two offensive linemen combo-block a single defender, the defender must split the double by getting low and driving between the two blockers. Even if the defender cannot split the double, he must occupy both blockers long enough to keep the linebackers behind him clean and free to pursue.

**Reach blocks**: When the offensive lineman attempts to reach across the defender's face to seal him inside, the defender must fight the reach by driving his hands into the blocker and maintaining outside leverage in his gap.

## Fitting Versus Specific Run Schemes

Different offensive run concepts test defensive run fits in different ways.

### Inside Zone

Against inside zone, the offensive line blocks laterally, each lineman working to create horizontal movement. The defensive lineman must maintain his gap and not get washed down the line. Staying square to the line of scrimmage and pressing his gap prevents the ball carrier from finding a vertical crease.

### Outside Zone

Outside zone stretches the defense horizontally, trying to get the ball to the edge. Defensive linemen must work laterally while maintaining gap integrity, not chasing the play so aggressively that they open cutback lanes behind them.

### Power and Counter

Gap-scheme runs like power and counter use pulling linemen to create numbers at the point of attack. The defensive lineman whose gap is targeted must hold his ground while the unblocked defenders fill their respective gaps against the pullers.

### Trap

Trap plays intentionally leave a defensive lineman unblocked at the snap, then bring a pulling guard to kick him out. The defender must recognize the unblocked setup and prepare for the trap block by squeezing down rather than rushing upfield into the trap.

## Communication and Adjustments

Run fits require constant communication. Defensive linemen must recognize offensive shifts, motions, and formation changes that alter blocking assignments. Calling out adjustments before the snap ensures every defender knows his responsibility.

Post-snap communication is equally important. Calling out blocks, pull direction, and ball-carrier location helps adjacent defenders adjust their fits in real time. Effective defensive lines play as a unit, with each member supporting the others through disciplined execution of their assigned run fits.

Proper run fits are not glamorous, but they are the backbone of every effective run defense in football.
