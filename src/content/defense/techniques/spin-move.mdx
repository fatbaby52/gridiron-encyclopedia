# Spin Move

The spin move is a high-risk, high-reward pass rush technique that uses rotational momentum to escape a blocker's grasp. Unlike the swim or rip, which attack past the blocker on the outside, the spin typically redirects the rusher back inside, catching the offensive lineman off balance. When executed with proper timing and body control, the spin move is one of the most devastating techniques in a pass rusher's arsenal.

## Mechanics of the Spin Move

The spin move requires exceptional body control, spatial awareness, and precise footwork. It is a more complex technique than the swim or rip, which is why it is often reserved for experienced players who have mastered the foundational moves first.

### Engaging the Blocker

The spin move begins with an aggressive initial engagement toward the blocker's outside shoulder. The rusher must sell the outside speed rush convincingly, forcing the offensive lineman to commit his momentum laterally. The harder the blocker kicks to protect the outside edge, the more vulnerable he becomes to the inside counter that the spin provides.

Contact is essential. The rusher should make physical contact with the blocker before initiating the spin, often with a hard chop or slap to the blocker's outside hand. This contact serves as both a misdirection tool and an anchor point for the rotational movement.

### Planting and Initiating the Spin

Once the blocker has committed to the outside rush, the rusher plants his outside foot firmly in the ground. This plant foot serves as the pivot point for the entire rotation. Placement is crucial: too wide and the spin carries the rusher away from the quarterback, too narrow and there is not enough momentum to clear the blocker.

From the plant, the rusher drops his inside shoulder and begins rotating his body 180 degrees back toward the inside. The rotation must be tight and compact, keeping the rusher's body close to the blocker to prevent the offensive lineman from simply reaching out and re-engaging.

### The Rotation

During the spin, the rusher must keep his eyes on the target. This sounds counterintuitive for a technique that involves turning away from the blocker, but experienced pass rushers learn to snap their head around quickly, re-acquiring the quarterback before the rotation is complete. The spin is not a blind turn; it is a controlled redirection.

The arms play an important role during the rotation. The inside arm swipes across the blocker's body, acting as a clearing mechanism that prevents the blocker from reaching out and grabbing jersey. The outside arm wraps tight to the body during the spin to maintain a compact rotation.

### Acceleration Out of the Spin

The spin does not end when the rotation is complete. The rusher must immediately accelerate out of the spin toward the quarterback. This burst out of the turn is what makes the move effective. A spin that decelerates at the exit point gives the blocker time to recover and the quarterback time to escape.

The exit step should drive directly toward the quarterback's launch point. A common coaching cue is to "sprint through the spin," emphasizing that the rotational movement is not a pause in the rush but a change of direction within a continuous burst.

## When to Use the Spin Move

The spin move works best as a counter. When an offensive lineman has been beaten outside on previous plays and begins to overcommit to the speed rush, the spin back inside exploits that tendency. It is fundamentally a move built on deception, and deception is most effective when it contradicts an established pattern.

Interior defensive linemen also use the spin move effectively. A three-technique defensive tackle who engages the guard with a power rush and then spins back inside can create immediate interior pressure. The confined spaces along the interior of the line make the spin particularly dangerous because the quarterback has less room to escape.

The spin is most appropriate on passing downs when the rusher can take calculated risks. On early downs when run defense is a priority, the spin move can take the defender out of his gap responsibility, making it a less desirable choice.

## Risks and Drawbacks

The spin move carries more inherent risk than other pass rush techniques. Turning your back to the play, even momentarily, creates vulnerability. If the spin is not executed cleanly, the blocker can simply push the rusher past the play or the quarterback can step up into the vacated space.

Against mobile quarterbacks, the spin can be especially risky. A rusher who spins inside may find the quarterback scrambling to the outside edge he just abandoned.

## Developing the Spin Move

Mastering the spin requires thousands of repetitions. Coaches drill the footwork, rotation speed, and exit burst separately before combining them against live blockers. At the highest levels, the spin move is a weapon that can change games when deployed at the right moment.
