# Tackling in Space

Tackling in space refers to the challenge of bringing down a ball carrier in the open field, away from the congestion of the line of scrimmage where bodies and blockers limit movement. Open-field tackling is one of the most difficult skills in football because the ball carrier has maximum room to maneuver, juke, spin, and accelerate while the defender must close distance, maintain control, and execute a secure tackle without the benefit of teammates nearby to clean up a miss.

## Why Tackling in Space Is Different

At the line of scrimmage, defenders can use gap integrity, traffic, and teammate support to funnel ball carriers into tight spaces where tackling is relatively straightforward. In the open field, none of these advantages exist. The ball carrier has the full width of the field to work with, the defender is often isolated, and a missed tackle frequently results in a touchdown.

The dynamics change fundamentally in space. The ball carrier controls the engagement because he knows where he wants to go while the defender must react. The ball carrier can use speed, change of direction, and stiff arms to create separation. The defender must close distance while maintaining enough control to adjust to the ball carrier's moves.

## The Approach

The approach is the most critical phase of an open-field tackle. How the defender closes distance determines whether the tackle attempt has a chance of success.

### Controlled Speed

The defender must close the distance to the ball carrier quickly but under control. Sprinting full speed at a ball carrier in space is a recipe for a missed tackle because the defender cannot change direction at maximum velocity. Instead, the defender runs at about 80 percent speed as he approaches, with his feet under his body and his center of gravity balanced.

### The Breakdown

As the defender reaches a distance of approximately three to five yards from the ball carrier, he begins his breakdown. The breakdown is a deceleration phase where the defender shortens his stride, widens his base, sinks his hips, and prepares to react to the ball carrier's move. The breakdown is the transition from closing speed to tackling position.

The breakdown must happen at the right distance. Breaking down too far from the ball carrier gives the runner time and space to make a move without pressure. Breaking down too close leaves no time to react if the ball carrier changes direction.

### Buzzing the Feet

During the breakdown, the defender keeps his feet moving in short, rapid steps, often called "buzzing" or "chopping." These quick steps keep the defender's weight balanced and allow him to move laterally in any direction. A defender with dead feet is a stationary target that the ball carrier can easily evade.

## The Fit and Strike

Once the defender has closed to tackling distance, he must execute the tackle with proper technique.

### Aiming Point

The aiming point for an open-field tackle is the ball carrier's near hip. Targeting the hip gives the defender the best chance of wrapping up because the hips are the ball carrier's center of gravity and the point from which all cuts and moves originate. If the defender can control the hips, the ball carrier cannot escape.

### Head Placement

The defender's head placement is critical for both effectiveness and safety. Modern tackling technique teaches the defender to place his head to the side of the ball carrier rather than directly into the contact. The facemask slides past the ball carrier's body while the shoulder drives into the aiming point. This protects the defender's neck and spine while delivering force through the shoulder.

### Wrapping and Securing

The arms wrap around the ball carrier's thighs and squeeze together. The wrap must be tight and sustained, climbing the body if necessary to prevent the ball carrier from falling forward for extra yards. A shoulder hit without a wrap is not a tackle in space; it is a collision that ball carriers at every level can survive.

### Driving Through Contact

After contact and wrap, the defender drives his legs and runs through the ball carrier. The objective is to knock the ball carrier backward or sideways, taking him off his feet and preventing any forward progress. The tackle is complete only when the ball carrier is on the ground.

## Defending Moves in Space

### Against the Juke

Ball carriers use the juke, a quick lateral cut, to make defenders miss in space. The defender counters by maintaining his breakdown, keeping his feet active, and tracking the ball carrier's hips rather than his shoulders or head. The hips reveal the true direction of movement; everything else can be faked.

### Against the Stiff Arm

The stiff arm is a powerful weapon in open space. Defenders counter by attacking low, below the stiff arm, and wrapping up the legs. A defender who attacks high against a strong stiff arm will be pushed off balance.

### Against Speed

When the ball carrier attempts to outrun the defender to the edge, the defender must take a proper pursuit angle and use his speed to close the angle. Rather than chasing directly behind the ball carrier, the defender aims for a point ahead of the runner and drives to the intersection.

## Common Mistakes

The most frequent mistake is not breaking down, sprinting full speed into the tackle attempt and being unable to adjust when the ball carrier makes a move. Another common error is lunging, leaving the feet to dive at the ball carrier instead of maintaining a strong base. Aiming too high allows shifty runners to duck under the tackle. And not wrapping up after the initial contact turns a potential tackle into a glancing blow.

## Training Open-Field Tackling

Coaches use bag drills, angle-tackle drills, and one-on-one exercises in controlled settings to develop open-field tackling skills. The emphasis is on the approach, breakdown, and wrap rather than full-speed collisions. Repetition builds the muscle memory that allows defenders to execute sound technique under the pressure of game situations.

Tackling in space is the ultimate test of a defender's fundamentals, and it is the skill that most often determines whether a play goes for 5 yards or 50.
