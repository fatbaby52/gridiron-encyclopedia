Stunts and line games are coordinated movements by two or more defensive linemen designed to confuse offensive blocking assignments and create free rushers. Instead of each lineman rushing straight ahead into his assigned gap, stunts involve linemen crossing, looping, and exchanging gaps after the snap. The movement creates chaos along the offensive front, forcing blockers to pass off defenders and communicate in real time. When the communication breaks down, a defender comes free.

## Basic Stunt Concepts

The most fundamental stunt is the twist, or T-E stunt (tackle-end). The defensive tackle rushes first, crashing hard across the face of the offensive guard into the adjacent gap. The defensive end delays for a beat, then loops behind the tackle into the gap the tackle vacated. The guard blocks the tackle, and the offensive tackle must pick up the looping end. If the tackle hesitates or loses sight of the end, the loop produces a free rusher.

The E-T stunt reverses the order. The defensive end crashes inside first, and the defensive tackle loops around the end to the outside gap. This is effective against offensive lines that expect the tackle to move first and set their blocks accordingly.

The cross stunt sends two defenders in opposite directions simultaneously. The tackle crashes one way while the end crashes the other, and both exchange gaps at the same time. This is the most disruptive stunt because both offensive linemen must redirect simultaneously, and any miscommunication leaves a gap unprotected.

## Interior Stunts

Interior stunts involve the two defensive tackles or a nose tackle and a defensive tackle. These stunts attack the A and B gaps, the most protected areas of the offensive line.

The A-B twist sends one tackle through the A gap while the other loops to the B gap. The center and guard must communicate the exchange, and if either player loses his assignment, the looping tackle has a clear path to the quarterback.

The pinch stunt sends both tackles crashing inward to the A gaps simultaneously. This collapses the interior of the offensive line and creates running lanes for linebackers blitzing behind the stunt. The pinch is particularly effective on the goal line, where interior penetration disrupts both the running game and short passing game.

## Edge Stunts

Edge stunts involve the defensive end and an outside linebacker or secondary blitzer. The end crashes inside while the outside player loops around the end to the edge. These stunts attack the offensive tackle from multiple angles, making it nearly impossible for a single blocker to handle both threats.

The long loop stunt sends the outside player on a wide arc around the edge after the defensive end has attracted the tackle's attention inside. The delay between the end's crash and the outside player's arrival creates a timing gap that the offensive tackle cannot bridge.

The wrap stunt is similar but tighter. The outside player wraps behind the end and attacks the B or C gap rather than rushing wide around the edge. This stunt is effective against tackles who set wide to protect against the outside rush, leaving the inside gap vulnerable.

## Why Stunts Work

Stunts exploit the offensive line's communication process. Offensive linemen are taught to identify their man and block him. When defenders move after the snap, the linemen must pass off their original assignment and pick up the new threat. This requires verbal and visual communication between adjacent linemen, and any breakdown results in a free rusher.

The timing of the stunt is critical. The first mover must sell his rush aggressively enough to attract the blocker's full attention. If the initial move is tentative, the blocker will not commit, and the stunt will not create the desired confusion. The second mover must time his loop to arrive at the gap just as the first mover clears the blocker, creating a seamless exchange that the offense cannot react to.

Stunts also disrupt the quarterback's internal clock. A quarterback who reads a four-man rush and expects pressure from specific gaps is surprised when the rushers change direction post-snap. The unexpected angles of attack force the quarterback to adjust his pocket movement, and that adjustment often puts him directly in the path of the looping rusher.

## Stunts and the Running Game

While stunts are primarily a pass-rush tool, they also affect the running game. A stunt that moves a defensive tackle from the B gap to the A gap can disrupt zone-blocking schemes that depend on predictable defensive alignments. The offensive line's blocking assignments break down when the defenders are not where they expected them to be at the snap.

However, stunts are risky against the run. A looping defender takes himself out of his gap responsibility during the stunt, and if the offense runs directly at the vacated gap before the stunt completes, the runner has a clear lane. This is why most defensive coordinators limit stunts to obvious passing situations or pair them with a linebacker who fills the vacated gap.

## Coaching and Installation

Teaching stunts begins with the individual techniques. The first mover must learn to crash with speed and violence, selling the rush to attract the blocker. The second mover must learn to read the first mover's path and time his loop to arrive at the gap at the right moment. Too early, and the looper runs into the first mover. Too late, and the blocker recovers.

Stunts are installed in pairs. The coaching staff teaches one stunt combination at a time, repping it repeatedly until the timing is automatic. Once the pair is mastered, the next combination is added. Over the course of a season, a defensive line may have eight to twelve stunt combinations in its repertoire.

In the NFL, defensive lines run stunts on a significant percentage of passing plays. The best defensive lines, like those of the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, use stunts to generate pressure even when their individual rushers are not winning one-on-one matchups. The collective movement creates opportunities that individual talent alone cannot.

At the college and high school levels, stunts are a valuable tool for defensive lines that lack elite pass rushers. A coordinated stunt can produce a free rusher even when no individual defender can beat his man one-on-one. This makes stunts the great equalizer for less talented defensive fronts.
