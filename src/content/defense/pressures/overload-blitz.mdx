An overload blitz is a pressure scheme that sends more rushers to one side of the offensive formation than the offense can block on that side. The principle is simple arithmetic: if the offense has three blockers on one side of the center, the defense sends four rushers to that side. Someone comes free. The overload blitz is one of the most fundamental and effective concepts in pressure football, and it has been a staple of defensive game plans at every level for as long as coordinators have been scheming blitzes.

## The Arithmetic Principle

Every offensive protection scheme divides the blockers by side. In a standard five-man protection, the center and two guards handle the interior, while the two tackles handle the edges. The center typically helps one side based on the protection call, giving that side three interior blockers and the other side two.

The overload blitz attacks the side with fewer blockers. If the center helps to the right, the left side has only a guard and tackle to handle that side's rushers. The defense sends three rushers to the left, and the offense has only two blockers. The math does not work, and one rusher comes free.

Even when the offense uses six or seven blockers, the overload principle applies. If the offense keeps a tight end in to block on one side and a running back on the other, the defense can identify the weaker side and overload it. The key is recognition: the defense must identify the protection scheme and attack the side that cannot account for the extra rusher.

## Designing the Overload

Overload blitzes can come from any alignment and target any side. The most common overload targets the side away from the running back in a standard protection. If the running back aligns to the quarterback's right, the defense overloads the left side, forcing the offense to choose between keeping the back in to block (and losing a receiver) or letting the blitz come free.

Edge overloads are the most common variety. The defense sends two edge rushers from the same side, one from a wide alignment and one from a tighter position. The offensive tackle can handle one, but the second comes free inside or outside.

Interior overloads send multiple rushers through the A and B gaps on one side of the center. If the center is helping the opposite guard, the play-side guard faces two rushers alone. Interior overloads are particularly effective because they generate pressure directly in the quarterback's face, collapsing the pocket and eliminating his ability to step up.

Combination overloads mix edge and interior rushers on the same side. A linebacker blitzes the B gap while a defensive back rushes the C gap, and the defensive end takes his normal rush lane. Three rushers on one side against two blockers produces a free runner.

## Protection Beaters

Understanding offensive protection is essential to designing effective overloads. Slide protections, where the offensive line slides in one direction, are vulnerable to overloads on the side opposite the slide. The running back is responsible for picking up the extra rusher on the slide side, but the non-slide side has only individual blockers at each gap.

Man protections, where each lineman blocks a specific defender, are vulnerable to overloads that move defenders out of their expected positions. If the guard is assigned to block a specific linebacker and that linebacker shifts to a different gap, the guard may block air while the overloaded side produces a free rusher.

Half-slide protections, which combine a slide on one side with man blocking on the other, are vulnerable to overloads on the man side. The man-blocking side has fewer built-in adjustments, and an extra rusher can create problems that the blockers cannot solve with their rules.

## Coverage Behind the Overload

The coverage behind an overload blitz depends on the defensive coordinator's risk tolerance. Conservative overloads send five rushers with six in coverage, typically a Fire Zone or Cover 3 shell. Aggressive overloads send six or seven rushers with man coverage behind them.

The critical consideration is the area vacated by the overloading defenders. If two linebackers blitz from the same side, the underneath zone on that side is empty. The dropping defender or the coverage scheme must account for this void, or the offense will find it with a hot route or checkdown.

Zone-blitz overloads are particularly effective because the dropping defender fills the area vacated by the blitzer. The offense sees the overload but cannot throw to the hot route because a zone defender is sitting in that space.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

The overload blitz guarantees a free rusher when the arithmetic works. This is its greatest strength. No matter how talented the offensive line, they cannot block more defenders than they have blockers. The math is absolute.

The weakness is that the overload is directional. The pressure comes from one side, and if the quarterback escapes to the opposite side, he has time and space to find receivers in the areas vacated by the overloading defenders. Quarterbacks with mobility can sidestep the overload and turn a pressure play into a scramble or a big gain.

Hot routes and quick throws also beat overloads. A quarterback who recognizes the overload pre-snap can throw immediately to the side the blitz is coming from, where a defender has vacated his zone. This is why the coverage behind the overload is so important.

## Application Across Levels

Overload blitzes are universal. At every level, defensive coordinators use them to exploit protection weaknesses and create free rushers. At the high school level, overloads are often the first blitz concept taught because the arithmetic principle is easy to understand. At the college and NFL levels, overloads are more sophisticated, incorporating disguise, late movement, and combination rushes that make the overload difficult to identify pre-snap. The concept is timeless because it exploits a mathematical reality that no protection scheme can fully solve.
