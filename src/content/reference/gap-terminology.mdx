# Gap and Hole Terminology

The gap and hole numbering system is one of football's most fundamental reference tools. It provides a standardized way to identify the spaces along the offensive line where running plays are directed and where defensive responsibilities are assigned. Understanding this system is essential for reading playbooks, analyzing run schemes, and comprehending defensive gap assignments.

## What Is a Gap?

A gap is the space between two adjacent offensive linemen, or between the last lineman and the area outside the formation. Every offensive formation creates a set of gaps along the line of scrimmage, and both the offense and defense assign responsibilities based on these gaps. The offense aims to create openings in specific gaps through blocking, while the defense assigns players to fill or control specific gaps to stop the run.

## The Gap Lettering System

Gaps are identified by letters, starting from the center and working outward to each side.

**A Gap:** The space between the center and the guard on either side. There is a strong-side A-gap and a weak-side A-gap (or left A-gap and right A-gap, depending on the convention). The A-gaps are the narrowest and most congested spaces along the line. Plays directed at the A-gap are typically power runs and quarterback sneaks that require short, decisive forward movement.

**B Gap:** The space between the guard and the tackle on either side. The B-gap is one of the most commonly attacked gaps in modern football. The inside zone play often hits in the B-gap, and the 3-technique defensive tackle is specifically positioned to control the B-gap on defense.

**C Gap:** The space between the tackle and the tight end (if a tight end is present) or outside the tackle (if no tight end is on that side). The C-gap is a critical area for edge defenders, whose primary responsibility in many schemes is to prevent runners from getting outside the formation through the C-gap. Off-tackle runs and power plays frequently target the C-gap.

**D Gap:** The space outside the tight end, at the very edge of the formation. D-gap responsibility is often assigned to outside linebackers or contain defenders. Plays that reach the D-gap are typically sweeps, tosses, and outside zone runs that stretch the defense horizontally.

## The Hole Numbering System

While gaps are identified by letters, the traditional hole numbering system uses numbers to designate where a running play is directed. This system predates the gap-letter system and is still widely used, particularly in high school and college football.

### Even Numbers Right, Odd Numbers Left

The hole numbering system assigns even numbers to the right side of the formation and odd numbers to the left side, with the numbers increasing as they move away from the center.

- **0 Hole:** Directly over the center (sometimes used for a quarterback sneak)
- **1 Hole:** Left A-gap (between center and left guard)
- **2 Hole:** Right A-gap (between center and right guard)
- **3 Hole:** Left B-gap (between left guard and left tackle)
- **4 Hole:** Right B-gap (between right guard and right tackle)
- **5 Hole:** Left C-gap (between left tackle and tight end or outside left tackle)
- **6 Hole:** Right C-gap (between right tackle and tight end or outside right tackle)
- **7 Hole:** Left D-gap (outside the left tight end or left side of the formation)
- **8 Hole:** Right D-gap (outside the right tight end or right side of the formation)
- **9 Hole:** Far left edge, wide of the formation
- **0 (or 10) Hole:** Far right edge, wide of the formation

In practice, a play call like "34 Dive" might mean the 3-back (fullback) runs into the 4-hole (right B-gap). The specific numbering conventions can vary between coaching staffs, but the general principle of odd/even for left/right is nearly universal.

## Defensive Gap Responsibilities

On defense, gap control is the foundation of run defense. Every defensive scheme assigns each front-seven player a specific gap to control. If every defender maintains his gap, the running back has nowhere to go. Run defense breakdowns almost always involve a defender failing to control his assigned gap.

### One-Gap vs. Two-Gap Schemes

Defensive fronts are broadly categorized as one-gap or two-gap based on how linemen are assigned.

**One-gap schemes** assign each defensive lineman a single gap to penetrate and control. The 3-technique defensive tackle in a 4-3 defense, for example, is responsible for the B-gap. One-gap defenders attack their gap aggressively at the snap, trying to get into the backfield and disrupt the play. This scheme is predicated on penetration and is often used by teams with athletic, quick defensive linemen.

**Two-gap schemes** assign each defensive lineman two gaps to control. A 0-technique nose tackle in a 3-4 defense, for example, might be responsible for both A-gaps. Two-gap defenders engage the offensive lineman in front of them, hold their ground, and read the play before shedding the block and making the tackle. This scheme is predicated on control and requires large, strong defensive linemen who can hold the point of attack.

Most modern defenses mix one-gap and two-gap responsibilities depending on the play call and the defensive front. A defensive end might be one-gapping his C-gap on a passing down but two-gapping in a base run defense.

## Gap Integrity and the Running Game

Offensive run schemes are designed to create gaps by moving defenders out of their assigned positions. Zone runs work by getting all five linemen moving in one direction, hoping to create a cutback lane when a defender follows the flow. Gap runs use pulling linemen and double teams to create a numbers advantage at the point of attack. In both cases, the offense is trying to find or create an undefended gap.

The chess match between offensive blocking schemes and defensive gap assignments is at the heart of football. Every running play succeeds because a gap was opened, and every defensive stop occurs because the gaps were controlled. Understanding the gap and hole system provides the framework for analyzing this essential element of the game.

## Practical Application

When watching football, you can identify gaps by finding the spaces between the offensive linemen before the snap. Watch which gap the running back aims for and whether the offensive line successfully creates an opening. On defense, identify which player is responsible for each gap and evaluate whether they maintain their assignment. This gap-based analysis transforms how you see every running play and is the starting point for understanding both offensive and defensive line play at a deeper level.
