# Personnel Packages

Personnel packages describe the combination of players on the field for a given play. In football, the offense chooses its personnel grouping, and the defense then has the opportunity to substitute in response. Understanding personnel packages is critical for recognizing formations, anticipating play tendencies, and grasping the strategic chess match between offense and defense.

## The Numbering System

Offensive personnel packages are described using a two-digit numbering system. The first digit represents the number of running backs, and the second digit represents the number of tight ends. Since an offense always has five offensive linemen and a quarterback on the field, the remaining five positions are divided among running backs, tight ends, and wide receivers. The number of wide receivers is determined by subtracting the running backs and tight ends from five.

### Common Personnel Groupings

**11 Personnel (1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR):** This is the most common personnel grouping in modern football, particularly in the NFL. Three wide receivers spread the defense and create favorable matchups, while the single tight end provides blocking support and a receiving option. The 11 personnel grouping is versatile enough to support a wide range of run and pass concepts.

**12 Personnel (1 RB, 2 TE, 2 WR):** The second most common grouping, 12 personnel provides additional blocking for the run game while maintaining passing flexibility through two tight ends who can run routes. This grouping is popular in the Shanahan system and with teams that feature athletic tight ends.

**21 Personnel (2 RB, 1 TE, 2 WR):** Two running backs and a tight end create a strong run-game identity. The second back can serve as a lead blocker (fullback) or as a receiving threat. This grouping was more common in earlier eras but remains in use by teams that value physicality and misdirection.

**22 Personnel (2 RB, 2 TE, 1 WR):** A heavy personnel grouping that signals a commitment to the run game. With two backs and two tight ends, the offense has significant blocking resources. However, the single wide receiver limits passing options, making this grouping predictable in certain situations.

**10 Personnel (1 RB, 0 TE, 4 WR):** Four wide receivers spread the defense to its limit and are typically used in obvious passing situations. The lack of a tight end reduces blocking support but maximizes the number of receiving threats on the field.

**00 Personnel (0 RB, 0 TE, 5 WR):** An empty backfield with five receivers is used in extreme passing situations. The quarterback has no back to help with pass protection, making quick reads and a fast release essential. This grouping puts maximum stress on the defense's coverage but is vulnerable to the blitz.

**13 Personnel (1 RB, 3 TE, 1 WR):** Three tight ends provide substantial blocking power and are used in goal-line and short-yardage situations. This grouping can also be used to create mismatches if the tight ends are capable receivers, as defenses may not have enough linebackers to match up.

**20 Personnel (2 RB, 0 TE, 3 WR):** Two backs with three receivers and no tight end is an unusual grouping that can create confusion for the defense. It can be used for draw plays and screen passes or for two-back pass routes that create matchup problems for linebackers.

## Defensive Personnel Responses

When the offense reveals its personnel grouping, the defense substitutes to match. The defensive personnel packages are described by the number of defensive backs on the field.

**Base defense (4 DB):** Four defensive backs (two cornerbacks and two safeties) are the standard alignment against run-heavy offensive groupings like 21 or 22 personnel.

**Nickel (5 DB):** Five defensive backs, with the fifth typically replacing a linebacker, are used to match 11 personnel and other three-receiver sets. The nickel has become so common that many teams consider it their base defense.

**Dime (6 DB):** Six defensive backs are used against four-receiver sets (10 personnel) and obvious passing situations. A dime defense sacrifices run-stopping ability for additional pass coverage.

**Quarter (7 DB):** Seven defensive backs are rare but used in extreme passing situations, such as prevent defense at the end of a half. This alignment is sometimes called "dollar" or "quarter" depending on the team.

## Personnel and Play Tendency

Personnel groupings create tendencies that both offenses and defenses exploit. Teams in 11 personnel pass more often than they run, while teams in 22 personnel run more often than they pass. Smart offenses use these tendencies to set up constraint plays: running the ball out of 11 personnel, for example, catches a defense that has substituted nickel personnel and may be vulnerable against the run.

The concept of "personnel diplomacy" describes the cat-and-mouse game between offense and defense during substitution periods. The offense may show one personnel grouping to draw a specific defensive response and then motion or shift into a different alignment that creates a mismatch. This is why coaches pay close attention to not just what personnel is on the field but how those players are aligned.

## Personnel at Different Levels

The prevalence of different personnel groupings varies by level of play. The NFL is heavily concentrated in 11 personnel, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of all snaps. College football uses more varied groupings, including heavy sets in power-running teams and empty sets in spread offenses. High school football tends to use heavier personnel groupings due to the relative scarcity of skilled receivers and the emphasis on the running game at many programs.

Understanding personnel packages is one of the most practical analytical tools for watching football. By identifying the personnel grouping before the snap, a viewer can anticipate the types of plays likely to be called and understand why the defense is aligned the way it is. It is the starting point for reading the game within the game.
