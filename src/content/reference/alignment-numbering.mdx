# Alignment and Technique Numbering

The technique numbering system is one of football's most important communication tools. It provides a precise, standardized way to describe where a defensive player aligns relative to the offensive linemen. Understanding technique numbers is essential for studying defensive schemes, evaluating player assignments, and communicating between coaches and players.

## Origins

The technique numbering system is widely attributed to Paul "Bear" Bryant, the legendary Alabama head coach, though variations had been used by other coaches before him. Bryant codified the system to give his coaching staff a consistent language for describing defensive alignments. Over time, the system became universal and is now used at every level of football.

## The Numbering System

Technique numbers are assigned based on where a defensive player lines up relative to the offensive linemen. The system uses numbers from 0 through 9, with even numbers representing head-up alignments and odd numbers representing shade (offset) alignments.

### Interior Techniques

**0 Technique:** Head up on the center. A 0-technique player lines up directly over the center, splitting him evenly. This is the classic nose tackle alignment in a 3-4 defense. The 0-technique's primary responsibility is typically to control both A-gaps and occupy the center and potentially both guards.

**1 Technique:** Shading the center. A 1-technique player aligns on the center's shoulder, tilted toward one A-gap. This alignment allows the defender to attack a specific A-gap while remaining close enough to the center to influence the other.

**2i Technique:** Head up on the guard, inside shade. The "i" denotes an inside shade, meaning the defender is on the guard's inside shoulder, closer to the center. This alignment is common in four-man defensive fronts.

**2 Technique:** Head up on the guard. A 2-technique player aligns directly over the guard, splitting him. This is a standard alignment for defensive tackles in a 4-3 defense.

**3 Technique:** Outside shade of the guard. A 3-technique player aligns on the guard's outside shoulder, positioned in the B-gap between the guard and tackle. The 3-technique is one of the most important positions in modern defensive football, as it provides a favorable pass-rushing alignment with a direct path to the quarterback.

### Edge Techniques

**4i Technique:** Inside shade of the tackle. The defender aligns on the offensive tackle's inside shoulder. This alignment is used by defensive ends who are responsible for the B-gap in certain schemes.

**4 Technique:** Head up on the tackle. The defender aligns directly over the offensive tackle. This is a base alignment for defensive ends in a 3-4 defense, where the end is expected to hold the point of attack and occupy blockers.

**5 Technique:** Outside shade of the tackle. The defender aligns on the offensive tackle's outside shoulder. The 5-technique is the classic alignment for a 3-4 defensive end. The player is responsible for the C-gap and must be strong enough to set the edge against the run while also providing pass-rush ability.

**6 Technique:** Head up on the tight end. When a tight end is present, a defender aligned directly over him is in a 6-technique. This is a common alignment for outside linebackers and strong-side defensive ends.

**7 Technique:** Inside shade of the tight end. The defender aligns on the tight end's inside shoulder, positioning himself in the C-gap between the tackle and the tight end.

### Wide Techniques

**8 Technique:** Outside shade of the tight end. A defender aligned on the tight end's outside shoulder is responsible for containment, ensuring that runners cannot get outside the formation.

**9 Technique:** Wide alignment outside the tight end or tackle. The 9-technique is the widest standard alignment and is used by speed rushers and outside linebackers who are primarily responsible for rushing the passer from the edge. A 9-technique defender lines up well outside the last man on the line of scrimmage.

## Shade and Half Techniques

Some coaches use additional modifiers to describe alignments between the standard techniques.

**Inside shade (i):** As noted with the 2i, an "i" suffix indicates the defender is on the inside shoulder of the offensive player. For example, a 4i-technique is on the tackle's inside shoulder.

**Outside shade:** Some systems use a plus sign or other notation to indicate an outside shade that is not quite the next full technique.

## Why Techniques Matter

The technique number tells both the defensive player and the coaching staff exactly where the player should align and, by extension, what his responsibilities are. A 3-technique defensive tackle is expected to penetrate the B-gap and disrupt the backfield. A 5-technique end is expected to hold the point of attack and contain the edge. A 0-technique nose is expected to eat up blockers and clog the middle of the line.

When coaches describe a defensive front, they use technique numbers to paint a precise picture. A "4-3 over front with a 1-tech, 3-tech, 5-tech, and 9-tech" tells every coach and player exactly where the four down linemen will align. This precision eliminates ambiguity and allows for rapid communication.

## Application Across Schemes

Different defensive schemes emphasize different techniques. A traditional 4-3 defense might feature a 1-technique and a 3-technique at defensive tackle with two 5-technique or 7-technique ends. A 3-4 defense might feature a 0-technique nose with two 5-technique ends. Modern hybrid defenses mix and match techniques based on the offensive formation and the game situation.

Understanding the technique numbering system transforms how you watch football. Instead of seeing a generic "defensive line," you can identify each player's specific alignment and anticipate his assignment. It is one of the foundational reference tools for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of defensive football.
