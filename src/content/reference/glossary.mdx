## Overview

This glossary provides definitions for the most commonly used terms in American football. Whether you are a beginning fan trying to follow a broadcast, a new player learning the game, or a coach looking for a quick reference, this resource covers terminology from offense, defense, special teams, strategy, penalties, and more. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

---

## A

**A-Gap**: The space between the center and the guard on either side of the offensive line. The A-gaps are the two interior-most running lanes.

**Ace Formation**: An offensive formation featuring one running back, one tight end, and three wide receivers. Sometimes called "singleback."

**Audible**: A change of play called by the quarterback at the line of scrimmage before the snap. The quarterback recognizes something in the defense and verbally changes the play to a better option.

**All-Purpose Yards**: A statistical category that combines rushing yards, receiving yards, and return yards for a single player.

**Alignment**: The positioning of a player relative to the formation before the snap. Defensive alignments are often described using a numbering technique system.

**Arm Tackle**: A tackle attempt made primarily with the arms rather than wrapping up with the full body. Generally considered a poor technique.

**Audibilize**: The act of calling an audible; changing the play at the line of scrimmage.

---

## B

**Backfield**: The area behind the line of scrimmage where the quarterback, running backs, and fullbacks line up. Also used to describe the defensive secondary (defensive backfield).

**Backside**: The side of the formation away from where the play is designed to go. The backside guard, for example, is the guard on the opposite side of the intended run direction.

**Ball Carrier**: The player who has possession of the football during a play.

**Blitz**: A defensive play in which one or more linebackers or defensive backs rush the quarterback in addition to the defensive linemen. Blitzes aim to create pressure by sending more rushers than the offense can block.

**Block**: The act of using one's body to impede or move a defender to create space for the ball carrier or protect the quarterback.

**Bootleg**: A play-action pass in which the quarterback fakes a handoff in one direction and rolls out to the opposite side to throw. Designed to exploit the defense's reaction to the run fake.

**Box**: The area near the line of scrimmage between the offensive tackles and approximately five to seven yards deep. The number of defenders "in the box" is a key pre-snap read for quarterbacks and running backs.

**Broken Play**: A play that does not develop as designed, forcing the quarterback or ball carrier to improvise.

**Bump-and-Run**: A coverage technique in which the cornerback makes contact with the wide receiver at the line of scrimmage (within the first five yards in the NFL) before transitioning into coverage.

**Bunch Formation**: An offensive alignment in which three receivers line up close together on one side of the formation, creating natural pick and rub opportunities.

**Byweek**: A scheduled week off during the regular season when a team does not play a game. Also spelled "bye week."

---

## C

**Cadence**: The series of signals, words, and sounds the quarterback uses before the snap. The cadence communicates the snap count and can be used to draw the defense offside.

**Chain Gang**: The sideline crew that operates the first-down markers (chains) and the down marker. The chains measure the 10 yards needed for a first down.

**Checkdown**: A short pass to a running back or other receiver when the quarterback's primary and secondary targets are covered. The checkdown is the quarterback's safety valve.

**Chip Block**: A brief block by a running back or tight end on a pass rusher before releasing into a pass route. Used to help slow down a dominant pass rusher.

**Clipping**: An illegal block in which a player hits an opponent from behind and below the waist. Results in a 15-yard penalty.

**Clock Management**: The strategic use of time during a football game, including decisions about when to use timeouts, hurry up, or slow down.

**Coffin Corner**: The area of the field near the intersection of the goal line and the sideline. Punters aim for the coffin corner to pin the opponent deep.

**Completion Percentage**: A quarterback statistic calculated by dividing the number of completed passes by the number of pass attempts.

**Contain**: A defensive responsibility requiring a player to keep the ball carrier from getting outside to the edge of the defense.

**Counter**: A running play in which the ball carrier takes a step in one direction before cutting back the opposite way, often with pulling linemen leading the way.

**Coverage**: The defensive scheme used to defend against the pass. See "Man Coverage" and "Zone Coverage."

**Crack-Back Block**: A block by a wide receiver who lines up outside and blocks back toward the middle of the field against a defender. Illegal if below the waist in most situations.

**Curl Route**: A pass route in which the receiver runs upfield a set distance, then turns back toward the quarterback. Also called a "hook" or "comeback" depending on the depth and angle.

**Cut Block**: A low block aimed at a defender's legs, typically used by offensive linemen in zone-blocking schemes. Legal in certain situations but restricted in others.

**Cutback**: A running back's change of direction away from the designed hole to a less congested area of the field.

---

## D

**Dead Ball**: A period when the ball is not in play, either between downs or after a play has ended.

**Dime Package**: A defensive personnel grouping featuring six defensive backs. Used in obvious passing situations to add coverage players.

**Down**: One of four consecutive attempts (plays) the offense has to advance the ball 10 yards and earn a new set of downs.

**Down and Distance**: The current down number and the number of yards needed to gain a first down (e.g., "2nd and 7" means it is second down with seven yards to go).

**Down Lineman**: A defensive player who lines up with a hand on the ground (in a three-point or four-point stance) at the line of scrimmage.

**Draft**: The annual event in which NFL teams select eligible college players. Teams pick in an order generally determined by the previous season's record (worst to first).

**Draw Play**: A designed running play that begins with the quarterback dropping back as if to pass, drawing the defensive linemen upfield, before handing the ball to a running back who runs through the vacated space.

**Drive**: A series of offensive plays that begins when a team takes possession of the ball and ends when they score, punt, turn the ball over, or the half ends.

**Drop**: The quarterback's backward movement from the line of scrimmage after receiving the snap, creating space to throw. Common drops are three-step, five-step, and seven-step.

**Drop-Off**: A short pass thrown to a receiver who has settled into an open area of a zone defense. Also, a defensive back who drops into coverage rather than blitzing.

---

## E

**Eligible Receiver**: A player who is legally allowed to catch a forward pass. In the NFL, this includes all backs, wide receivers, tight ends, and the players on each end of the offensive line.

**Encroachment**: A penalty called when a defensive player enters the neutral zone and makes contact with an offensive player before the snap. Results in a five-yard penalty.

**End Around**: A play in which a wide receiver motions behind the quarterback and takes a handoff, running around the end of the offensive line.

**End Zone**: The 10-yard-deep area at each end of the field. A team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone.

**Extra Point (PAT)**: A kick attempt following a touchdown, worth one point if successful. The ball is snapped from the 15-yard line in the NFL (the 3-yard line in college and high school). Also called the "point after touchdown."

---

## F

**Face Mask**: A penalty called when a player grabs the face mask or helmet opening of an opponent. A 15-yard personal foul penalty.

**Fair Catch**: A signal made by a punt or kickoff returner (by raising one arm above the head) indicating they will not attempt to advance the ball after catching it. The returner is protected from being hit.

**False Start**: A penalty called when an offensive player moves before the snap in a way that simulates the start of the play. Results in a five-yard penalty.

**Field Goal**: A scoring play worth three points, executed by the placekicker kicking the ball through the uprights of the goalpost. Can be attempted from any distance on any down, though it is most commonly attempted on fourth down.

**Field Position**: The location of the ball on the field relative to the end zones. Good field position means the offense is closer to the opponent's end zone.

**Flanker**: A wide receiver who lines up off the line of scrimmage, typically split wide. Often referred to as the "Z receiver."

**Flat**: The area of the field near the sideline and behind the line of scrimmage. Running backs and tight ends frequently run routes into the flat.

**Formation**: The arrangement of offensive or defensive players before the snap. Formations are identified by the number and positioning of players at each position.

**Forward Progress**: The furthest point the ball carrier advances toward the opponent's end zone before being tackled or pushed backward. The ball is spotted at the point of forward progress.

**Free Safety**: A defensive back who typically lines up deep in the middle of the field and is responsible for covering deep passes and providing run support. Often the deepest defender in the secondary.

**Fumble**: A live ball that is dropped or knocked loose from the ball carrier. A fumble can be recovered by either team.

---

## G

**Gap**: The space between two adjacent offensive linemen. Gaps are labeled with letters (A-gap, B-gap, C-gap, D-gap) from the center outward.

**Goal Line**: The line at the front of each end zone. A touchdown is scored when the ball crosses the plane of the opponent's goal line.

**Grounding (Intentional)**: A penalty called when the quarterback throws the ball away to avoid a sack without a receiver in the area and without being outside the tackle box. Results in a loss of down and a 10-yard penalty (or the ball is spotted at the point of the foul, whichever is worse).

**Guard**: An offensive lineman who lines up on either side of the center. Guards block for both running and passing plays and may pull (move laterally) to lead running plays.

**Gunner**: A special teams player, usually positioned at the widest point of the punt formation, who sprints downfield to tackle the punt returner or down the ball.

---

## H

**Halfback (HB)**: An offensive backfield player, typically the primary ball carrier. In modern football, the halfback is often called the "running back" or "tailback."

**Hail Mary**: A long, desperation pass thrown toward the end zone, usually at the end of a half or game. Named after Roger Staubach's famous last-second throw in a 1975 playoff game.

**Handoff**: The act of the quarterback giving the ball directly to a running back or other ball carrier.

**Hash Marks**: The short lines running down the center of the field that indicate each yard line. In the NFL, the hash marks are 18 feet, 6 inches apart. In college, they are 40 feet apart. In high school, they are 53 feet, 4 inches apart. The wider the hash marks, the more the field is divided into a "wide side" and a "short side."

**Holding**: A penalty called when a player illegally grabs or restrains an opponent. Offensive holding results in a 10-yard penalty; defensive holding results in a 5-yard penalty and an automatic first down.

**Hole**: A gap in the offensive line through which the running back is designed to run. Holes are often numbered in the play-calling system.

**Hot Route**: A pre-determined quick pass route that a receiver runs when the quarterback identifies an incoming blitz. The receiver adjusts their route to provide the quarterback with a quick outlet.

**Huddle**: The gathering of offensive or defensive players between plays to receive the play call. Some teams operate without a huddle (no-huddle offense) to increase tempo.

---

## I

**I-Formation**: An offensive formation in which the quarterback lines up directly behind the center, with the fullback and tailback lined up behind the quarterback in a straight line, forming a letter "I."

**Illegal Formation**: A penalty called when the offense does not have at least seven players on the line of scrimmage at the snap, or when eligible and ineligible receivers are not properly positioned.

**Illegal Motion**: A penalty called when an offensive player is moving forward at the time of the snap or when two players are in motion simultaneously.

**In the Grasp**: A ruling by the referee that the quarterback has been effectively tackled even though they have not been brought to the ground, called to protect the quarterback from unnecessary hits.

**Incompletion**: A forward pass that is not caught by any player. The ball is returned to the previous line of scrimmage, the clock stops, and the next down is played.

**Interception**: A pass caught by a defensive player, resulting in a change of possession. The player who intercepts the ball may attempt to return it.

---

## J

**Jailbreak Blitz**: A blitz in which multiple defenders rush the quarterback from different angles simultaneously, overwhelming the offensive line's protection.

**Jet Sweep**: A quick running play in which a wide receiver motions across the formation at full speed and takes a handoff near the line of scrimmage, attacking the edge.

**Juke**: A quick, deceptive move by a ball carrier to evade a tackler.

---

## K

**Keeper**: A running play in which the quarterback keeps the ball and runs rather than handing off. Often part of option or read-option schemes.

**Key**: A pre-snap or post-snap indicator that a player reads to determine their assignment. Linebackers, for example, may key on the running back's movement to diagnose the play.

**Kick Return**: The play following a kickoff in which the receiving team attempts to advance the ball.

**Kicker**: The player responsible for kickoffs, field goals, and extra points. Also called the "placekicker."

---

## L

**Lateral**: A pass thrown sideways or backward (not forward). A lateral is a live ball and can be thrown at any time during a play, by any player. If dropped, it is a fumble.

**Line of Scrimmage (LOS)**: The imaginary line running across the width of the field at the point where the ball is spotted. Both teams line up on their respective sides of the line of scrimmage before the snap.

**Linebacker (LB)**: A defensive player who typically lines up behind the defensive line and in front of the secondary. Linebackers are responsible for stopping the run, rushing the passer, and covering receivers.

**Live Ball**: A ball that is in play. A fumbled ball is a live ball; a dead ball is not.

**Loaded Box**: A defensive alignment in which eight or more defenders are positioned near the line of scrimmage, typically to defend against the run.

**Long Snapper**: A specialized offensive lineman who snaps the ball to the punter or holder on field goal and extra point attempts. The long snapper must deliver a quick, accurate snap over a longer distance than a regular center snap.

---

## M

**Man Coverage (Man-to-Man)**: A pass defense scheme in which each defender is responsible for covering a specific offensive player, following them wherever they go on the field.

**Mesh Point**: The moment during an option or read-option play when the quarterback and running back come together and the quarterback decides whether to hand the ball off or keep it.

**Middle Linebacker (MLB)**: The linebacker who typically lines up in the middle of the defensive formation. Often the defensive signal-caller responsible for relaying play calls.

**Motion**: Pre-snap movement by an offensive player who runs parallel to or away from the line of scrimmage before the snap. Only one player may be in motion at the snap, and they must not be moving toward the line of scrimmage (in the NFL).

**Muff**: A failed attempt to catch or handle a kicked ball (punt or kickoff). A muffed ball is a live ball that can be recovered by either team.

**Muffed Punt**: When the punt returner touches but fails to catch a punt. The kicking team can recover the muff but (in most rules) cannot advance it.

---

## N

**Neutral Zone**: The area between the forward and backward points of the football before it is snapped. No player from either team (other than the center) may be in the neutral zone at the snap.

**Nickel Package**: A defensive personnel grouping featuring five defensive backs (replacing a linebacker). Used in passing situations to add an extra coverage player.

**No-Huddle**: An offensive tempo strategy in which the team does not huddle between plays, instead receiving the play call from the sideline via signals or a wristband. Designed to prevent defensive substitutions and maintain a fast pace.

**Nose Tackle (NT)**: A defensive lineman who lines up directly over the center, typically in a 3-4 defense. The nose tackle's primary job is to occupy blockers and clog the middle of the line.

---

## O

**Offside**: A penalty called when a defensive player crosses the line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped. Results in a five-yard penalty. Distinguished from encroachment, which involves contact with an offensive player.

**Onside Kick**: A short kickoff designed for the kicking team to recover. The ball must travel at least 10 yards before the kicking team can legally touch it.

**Option**: An offensive play in which the quarterback reads a specific defender and decides whether to hand off, keep, or pitch the ball based on the defender's reaction.

**Out Route**: A pass route in which the receiver runs upfield and then breaks sharply toward the sideline.

**Outside Linebacker (OLB)**: A linebacker who lines up on the outside of the defensive formation. In a 3-4 defense, outside linebackers often function as pass rushers.

**Over/Under Front**: Defensive line alignments that shift the line toward one side (over) or away from the strength of the offensive formation (under).

**Overtime**: An additional period played when the game is tied at the end of regulation. NFL overtime rules differ from college rules (which use an alternating possession format).

---

## P

**Pass Interference (PI)**: A penalty called when a player significantly hinders an eligible receiver's or defender's opportunity to catch the ball. Offensive pass interference results in a 10-yard penalty. Defensive pass interference in the NFL results in a spot foul (ball placed at the spot of the foul); in college, it is a 15-yard penalty.

**Pass Rush**: The effort by defensive players to reach and tackle (sack) the quarterback before they can throw the ball.

**PAT (Point After Touchdown)**: See "Extra Point."

**Penalty**: A sanction imposed by the officials for a rule violation, typically resulting in yardage being assessed against the offending team.

**Pick (Screen)**: In common usage, "pick" has two meanings: (1) an interception, and (2) an illegal play in which an offensive player deliberately blocks a defender to free another receiver (if it involves intentional contact, it is offensive pass interference).

**Pistol Formation**: An offensive formation in which the quarterback lines up a few yards behind the center (closer than shotgun) with the running back directly behind the quarterback. Combines elements of shotgun and under-center play.

**Play-Action**: A passing play that begins with the quarterback faking a handoff to a running back, designed to deceive the defense into thinking it is a run play. Play-action passes are most effective when the team has an established running game.

**Play Clock**: The clock that limits the time between plays. In the NFL, the offense has 40 seconds from the end of the previous play (or 25 seconds after certain stoppages) to snap the ball.

**Pocket**: The protected area behind the offensive line where the quarterback stands to throw. The pocket is formed by the offensive tackles, guards, and center.

**Post Route**: A deep pass route in which the receiver runs upfield and then angles toward the goalpost (toward the middle of the field).

**Prevent Defense**: A defensive strategy using extra defensive backs and playing deep coverage, designed to prevent big plays and force the offense to consume time on short gains.

**Pull**: The technique in which an offensive lineman leaves their position at the snap and moves laterally to block on the opposite side of the formation or at the point of attack.

**Pump Fake**: A deceptive motion by the quarterback who simulates throwing the ball to freeze defenders or cause them to commit before throwing to another target.

**Punt**: A kick made by dropping the ball and kicking it before it hits the ground, used to surrender possession while pushing the opponent back in terms of field position.

---

## Q

**Quarterback (QB)**: The offensive player who receives the snap, directs the play, and is the primary passer. The quarterback is the most important position in football and the on-field leader of the offense.

**Quarterback Sneak**: A short-yardage play in which the quarterback takes the snap and immediately pushes forward behind the center, typically used on 4th and 1 or near the goal line.

**Quick-Out**: A short pass route in which the receiver takes a few steps upfield and then breaks sharply toward the sideline. A timing route that requires a quick throw.

**Quick Slant**: A short pass route in which the receiver takes one or two steps upfield before breaking at a 45-degree angle toward the middle of the field. One of the most commonly used routes in football.

---

## R

**Read Option (Zone Read)**: An offensive play in which the quarterback reads a designated defender (usually the backside defensive end) after the snap and decides whether to hand the ball to the running back or keep it and run. A foundational concept of the modern spread offense.

**Red Zone**: The area of the field between the opponent's 20-yard line and the goal line. See the full article on Red Zone Strategy.

**Return**: The act of advancing the ball after receiving a punt or kickoff.

**Reverse**: A play in which the ball is handed off to a player running in one direction, who then hands off to another player running in the opposite direction.

**Rollout**: A play in which the quarterback moves laterally behind the offensive line rather than dropping straight back, often used to create a moving pocket or to set up a bootleg pass.

**Roster**: The list of players on a team. NFL teams have 53-man active rosters during the regular season with 46 players active on game day.

**RPO (Run-Pass Option)**: A play in which the offensive line blocks for a run while the quarterback has the option to hand off or pull the ball and throw a quick pass based on a post-snap read of a designated defender.

**Running Back (RB)**: An offensive player who lines up in the backfield and is primarily responsible for carrying the ball on running plays. Also involved in pass protection and receiving.

---

## S

**Sack**: A play in which the quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage while attempting to pass. A sack results in a loss of yardage.

**Safety (Score)**: A scoring play worth two points for the defense, awarded when the offense is tackled, commits a penalty, or fumbles the ball out of bounds in their own end zone.

**Safety (Position)**: A defensive back who typically plays deep in the secondary. There are two types: free safety (who plays deep center) and strong safety (who plays closer to the line of scrimmage on the strong side).

**Scramble**: When the quarterback abandons the pocket and runs to avoid being sacked, either looking to throw on the run or gain yardage as a runner.

**Screen Pass**: A play designed to lure the pass rush upfield while the quarterback throws a short pass to a receiver (usually a running back) behind a wall of blockers.

**Seam Route**: A pass route in which a tight end or slot receiver runs straight up the field through the gap between a zone defense's deep and underneath coverage.

**Secondary**: The defensive backs, including cornerbacks and safeties. The secondary is primarily responsible for pass coverage.

**Shift**: A pre-snap movement in which one or more offensive players change their positions simultaneously. Unlike motion, a shift requires all players to be set for one second before the snap.

**Shotgun**: An offensive formation in which the quarterback lines up several yards behind the center and receives a long snap. The shotgun gives the quarterback more time and vision in the passing game.

**Sideline**: The boundary lines running the length of the field. A player is out of bounds when they touch the sideline or the area beyond it.

**Slant Route**: A quick pass route in which the receiver runs at a 45-degree angle toward the middle of the field. One of the most fundamental routes in football.

**Slot Receiver**: A wide receiver who lines up between the outside receiver and the offensive tackle, often in the gap between the line of scrimmage and the backfield.

**Snap**: The action of the center passing the ball between their legs to the quarterback (or punter/holder) to begin a play.

**Snap Count**: The signal in the quarterback's cadence that tells the offensive line when to snap the ball. Varying the snap count can draw the defense offside.

**Special Teams**: The units that take the field for kicking plays, including kickoffs, punts, field goals, and extra points.

**Spread Offense**: An offensive philosophy that distributes receivers across the field to create space and isolate matchups. See the full article on the Evolution of the Spread Offense.

**Stiff Arm**: A ball carrier's technique of extending an arm to push away a would-be tackler.

**Strong Side**: The side of the offensive formation with more players, typically the side where the tight end lines up.

**Stunt**: A coordinated movement by two or more defensive linemen in which they exchange gap responsibilities after the snap, designed to confuse the offensive line's blocking assignments.

**Sweep**: A running play in which the ball carrier runs laterally toward the sideline behind pulling linemen or lead blockers before turning upfield.

---

## T

**Tackle (Position)**: An offensive lineman positioned on the outside end of the line, or a defensive lineman in the interior of the defensive line.

**Tackle (Action)**: The act of bringing the ball carrier to the ground to end the play.

**Tackle Box**: The area between the offensive tackles extending from the line of scrimmage backward to the offense's end line. Relevant to intentional grounding rules (the quarterback must be outside the tackle box to throw the ball away legally).

**Tempo**: The pace at which the offense operates. Up-tempo or hurry-up offenses snap the ball quickly to prevent defensive substitutions and keep the defense off-balance.

**Tight End (TE)**: An offensive player who lines up on the line of scrimmage next to the offensive tackle. Tight ends serve as both blockers and pass receivers, making them among the most versatile players on the field.

**Time of Possession**: The total amount of game clock time that a team holds the ball during a game.

**Touchback**: A ruling that places the ball at a predetermined yard line (25 in the NFL and college for kickoffs, 20 for other plays) when the ball becomes dead in a team's own end zone after being put there by the opposing team.

**Touchdown (TD)**: A scoring play worth six points, awarded when a player carries the ball into or catches the ball in the opponent's end zone. After a touchdown, the scoring team attempts an extra point or two-point conversion.

**Trap Play**: A running play in which a defensive lineman is intentionally left unblocked at the snap, only to be blocked from the side by a pulling offensive lineman. The trap exploits an aggressive defender's penetration.

**Trips**: A formation in which three receivers are aligned on the same side of the field. Trips formations create overload situations that stress the defense's coverage responsibilities.

**Turnover**: A change of possession caused by a fumble recovery or interception by the defense. Turnovers are among the most significant plays in football, with turnover margin strongly correlating with winning.

**Two-Point Conversion**: After a touchdown, the offense may attempt to score two points (instead of kicking a one-point extra point) by running a play from the 2-yard line (NFL) or 3-yard line (college) and advancing the ball into the end zone.

---

## U

**Under Center**: An offensive alignment in which the quarterback lines up directly behind the center and takes the snap from hand to hand. The traditional quarterback alignment, contrasted with shotgun.

**Unnecessary Roughness**: A personal foul penalty called for excessively violent or dangerous contact, such as hitting a player who is already out of bounds or making helmet-to-helmet contact. Results in a 15-yard penalty.

**Unsportsmanlike Conduct**: A penalty called for behavior that violates the spirit of fair play, such as taunting, excessive celebration, or abusive language toward officials. Results in a 15-yard penalty.

**Uptempo**: See "Tempo."

---

## V

**Veer**: An option running play in which the quarterback reads a defensive player to determine whether to hand off to the running back on a dive play, keep the ball, or pitch to another back. A staple of triple-option offenses.

**Victory Formation**: A formation used by the team with the lead at the end of the game, in which the quarterback kneels immediately after the snap to run out the clock.

---

## W

**Waiver Wire**: The system by which NFL teams can claim players who have been released by other teams. Priority is generally given to teams with worse records.

**Weak Side**: The side of the offensive formation with fewer players, typically the side opposite the tight end.

**West Coast Offense**: An offensive system developed by Bill Walsh that emphasizes short, precisely timed passes to control the ball and advance methodically. The West Coast Offense uses the passing game to set up the run, inverting traditional offensive philosophy.

**Wide Receiver (WR)**: An offensive player who lines up near the sideline and is primarily responsible for running pass routes and catching the football. Wide receivers are classified as X, Y, or Z receivers depending on their alignment.

**Wildcat Formation**: An offensive formation in which a non-quarterback player (usually a running back) takes a direct snap from the center. The quarterback may line up as a wide receiver or not be on the field at all. The Wildcat was popularized by the Miami Dolphins in 2008.

**Window**: The space between defenders through which the quarterback must throw the ball to reach a receiver. A "tight window" means the space is small and the throw must be precise.

---

## X

**X Receiver**: The split end — a wide receiver who lines up on the line of scrimmage, typically on the opposite side of the formation from the tight end. The X receiver is often a team's best route-runner because they must defeat press coverage at the line without a free release.

---

## Y

**Y Receiver**: Typically the tight end in the passing game, or in some systems, the slot receiver. The Y receiver often runs intermediate routes over the middle of the field.

**Yards After Catch (YAC)**: The distance a receiver gains after catching the ball before being tackled. YAC is a key metric for evaluating a receiver's ability to create offense beyond the catch point.

**Yards After Contact (YACo)**: The distance a running back gains after initial contact with a defender. A measure of a runner's ability to break tackles.

---

## Z

**Z Receiver**: The flanker — a wide receiver who lines up off the line of scrimmage, typically on the same side as the tight end. Because the Z receiver is off the line, they can go in motion before the snap.

**Zone Blocking**: An offensive line blocking scheme in which linemen block an area (zone) rather than a specific defender. Zone blocking relies on double teams at the point of attack and allows the running back to read the blocks and find the cutback lane.

**Zone Coverage**: A pass defense scheme in which each defender is responsible for covering a specific area of the field rather than a specific receiver. Common zone coverages include Cover 2, Cover 3, Cover 4 (Quarters), and Cover 6.

**Zone Read**: See "Read Option."

**Zone Stretch**: A running play within the zone-blocking scheme in which the offensive line blocks laterally to stretch the defense horizontally. The running back reads the blocks and either follows the flow or cuts back against the grain.
