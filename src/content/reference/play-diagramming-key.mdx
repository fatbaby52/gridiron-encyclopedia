# Play Diagramming Key

Play diagrams are the visual language of football. Coaches, analysts, and players use standardized symbols and conventions to communicate plays, formations, and assignments on paper or on screen. Understanding these symbols is essential for reading playbooks, studying film breakdowns, and communicating football concepts clearly. This guide covers the standard conventions used across most levels of football.

## Player Symbols

Different shapes represent offensive and defensive players on a play diagram.

**Circles** represent offensive skill position players. A wide receiver, running back, or tight end is typically drawn as an open circle. Some systems use a filled (solid) circle for the ball carrier or the primary receiver on a passing play.

**Squares or rectangles** represent offensive linemen. The five offensive linemen are drawn as squares across the line of scrimmage. The center is often differentiated with a small mark or by being positioned at the center of the line.

**Triangles** represent defensive players. An inverted triangle (point down) is the most common convention. Some systems use different triangle sizes or fills to distinguish between defensive linemen, linebackers, and defensive backs.

**X and O notation.** In the simplest notation, "O" represents offensive players and "X" represents defensive players. This is the origin of the phrase "Xs and Os" to describe football strategy.

## Position Labels

Players on the diagram are typically labeled with their position abbreviation:

- **QB** -- Quarterback
- **RB** or **HB** -- Running back or halfback
- **FB** -- Fullback
- **WR** -- Wide receiver (sometimes **X**, **Y**, or **Z** for specific receiver positions)
- **TE** -- Tight end
- **C** -- Center
- **LG/RG** -- Left guard / Right guard
- **LT/RT** -- Left tackle / Right tackle

Defensive labels follow a similar convention:

- **DE** -- Defensive end
- **DT/NT** -- Defensive tackle / Nose tackle
- **LB** (OLB, MLB, ILB) -- Linebacker (outside, middle, inside)
- **CB** -- Cornerback
- **S** (SS, FS) -- Safety (strong safety, free safety)

## Route and Movement Lines

The lines drawn on a play diagram convey the type of movement each player is expected to make.

**Solid straight lines** indicate running paths. A solid line from the quarterback to the running back indicates a handoff path. A solid line from a receiver shows the initial stem of a route.

**Arrows** at the end of a line show the direction a player is moving at the conclusion of the diagrammed action. An arrow at the end of a receiver's route indicates the final direction of the route.

**Dashed or dotted lines** typically represent the path of the football. A dashed line from the quarterback to a receiver indicates a pass. A dashed line from the center to the quarterback indicates the snap.

**Wavy or zigzag lines** represent option routes or read-based movements, where the player's path depends on what the defense does. These are common in diagrams of the Run and Shoot or any system that uses choice routes.

**Curved lines** show players rounding their routes or following arced paths. A running back swinging out of the backfield on a wheel route, for example, would be drawn with a curved line.

## Blocking Symbols

Blocking assignments are indicated by specific symbols at the point of contact.

**A short perpendicular line (T-shape)** at the end of a player's path indicates a block. The blocker's line extends toward the defender and terminates in the perpendicular mark, showing that the blocker is engaging the defender.

**A curved hook** at the end of a blocker's line can indicate a reach block or a seal block, where the blocker is working to get to the defender's outside shoulder.

**Arrows through defenders** indicate a drive block, where the blocker is pushing the defender in a specific direction.

**Pull lines** show when an offensive lineman leaves his original position to block elsewhere. A pulling guard, for example, will have a line that moves laterally behind the line of scrimmage before turning upfield. Pull lines are often drawn with a distinctive looping shape.

## Formation Diagrams

Formations are diagrammed from the offense's perspective, looking toward the defense. The line of scrimmage is represented by a horizontal line, with offensive players below it and defensive players above it.

Players are placed according to their alignment. A receiver split wide to the right is drawn far to the right of the formation. A tight end aligned next to the tackle is drawn adjacent to the tackle's square. The spacing on the diagram should approximate the actual spacing on the field, though exact scale is not required.

## Motion Indicators

Pre-snap motion is shown with a horizontal arrow, often dashed or in a different color, running parallel to the line of scrimmage. The arrow starts at the player's original alignment and ends at the player's position at the snap. Some systems use a small "M" or "motion" label to clarify the pre-snap movement.

Shift movements, where multiple players reposition before the snap, are shown similarly but may involve multiple arrows and typically include a brief pause indicator to show that the players set before the snap.

## Defensive Diagrams

Defensive play diagrams use the same basic conventions but from the defense's perspective. Coverage zones are sometimes shown as shaded areas on the field. Blitz paths are drawn as solid lines with arrows. Spy or contain assignments may be shown with curved lines that indicate the defender's responsibility to mirror the quarterback's movement.

Zone drops are typically drawn as solid lines moving into the coverage area with a circled area indicating the zone the defender is responsible for. Man-to-man assignments are shown as lines that connect a defender to a specific offensive player.

## Reading Play Diagrams

When reading a play diagram, start with the formation to understand the personnel and alignment. Then read the movement lines to understand each player's assignment. Identify the blocking scheme by looking at the linemen's paths. Finally, look at the skill position routes and the ball's path to understand the play's intended result.

Familiarity with these conventions makes it possible to read any playbook or film breakdown, regardless of the specific system or level of play. The visual language of football is remarkably standardized, and learning it opens up a deeper understanding of the game.
