## Overview

Game planning is the process by which coaching staffs prepare a strategic approach tailored to a specific opponent. It is the intellectual foundation of competitive football, transforming raw talent and scheme knowledge into a targeted plan of attack. A game plan identifies an opponent's strengths and weaknesses, selects the plays and concepts most likely to exploit those weaknesses, and prepares contingency plans for various in-game scenarios. The game planning process begins immediately after the previous game and continues right up to kickoff, consuming the majority of a coaching staff's work week. At the professional level, game planning is a massive undertaking involving dozens of staff members, hundreds of hours of film study, and sophisticated data analysis.

## The Weekly Process

### Monday: Review and Reset

The game planning week typically begins on Monday (or the day after the previous game). The coaching staff reviews film from the previous game, identifies mistakes, and grades player performance. Once the review is complete, attention shifts to the upcoming opponent. The head coach establishes the week's priorities, and coordinators begin their initial film study of the opponent.

### Tuesday and Wednesday: Install

Tuesday and Wednesday are the primary installation days. Offensive and defensive coordinators present their game plans to the players, introducing the specific plays, formations, and concepts that will be used against the upcoming opponent. Practice on these days focuses on the first and second down offense, base defense, and the core elements of the game plan. Each coordinator selects 15 to 25 core plays that form the backbone of the game plan, building around concepts that attack the opponent's specific vulnerabilities.

### Thursday: Situational and Special Teams

Thursday's focus shifts to situational football — red zone, goal line, third down, and two-minute scenarios. The special teams game plan is also finalized on Thursday, with specific return schemes, coverage adjustments, and trick plays installed based on the opponent's tendencies. Thursday practice is typically shorter in duration, reflecting the need to keep players fresh as the game approaches.

### Friday and Saturday: Walkthrough and Final Preparation

Friday and Saturday are devoted to walkthroughs — low-intensity practices that reinforce the game plan without taxing the body. The coaching staff finalizes the call sheet, script, and any situational adjustments. Players review their individual assignments through film study and mental preparation.

## Film Study

### Breaking Down the Opponent

Film study is the cornerstone of game planning. Coaches watch every available snap of the opponent's previous games — typically the most recent 3 to 5 games — and chart tendencies in formation, personnel, play selection, and schematic approach. Offensive coordinators study the opponent's defensive front, coverage tendencies, and blitz packages. Defensive coordinators study the opponent's offensive formations, run-pass ratios, route concepts, and play-action tendencies.

### Identifying Tendencies

Tendencies are patterns in the opponent's play-calling that can be exploited. For example, an opponent that runs the ball 80 percent of the time out of 21 personnel (2 backs, 1 tight end) gives the defense a clear indicator. A defense that blitzes on 60 percent of third-and-long situations gives the offense a high probability of facing pressure. Identifying and cataloging these tendencies allows the coaching staff to build a game plan that anticipates and counters the opponent's most likely actions.

### Personnel Evaluation

Beyond scheme, game planning involves evaluating individual players on the opposing team. The coaching staff identifies the opponent's best and worst players at each position and designs the game plan to avoid the former and attack the latter. A weak cornerback on one side of the field may lead the offensive coordinator to call more passes targeting that matchup. A dominant defensive tackle may lead the offensive line coach to adjust blocking schemes to double-team that player.

## Building the Call Sheet

### Play Selection

The call sheet is the document — typically a laminated card — that the offensive or defensive coordinator uses during the game to call plays. The call sheet organizes plays by situation: first-and-10, second-and-medium, third-and-short, third-and-long, red zone, goal line, and so on. Each section contains 5 to 10 plays specifically selected for that situation based on the game plan's analysis of the opponent.

### Scripting the First 15

Many offensive coordinators script the first 10 to 15 plays of the game. The scripted sequence is designed to establish the offense's identity, test the defense's reactions to specific formations and concepts, and gather information about how the defense is playing. The scripted plays are not set in stone — the coordinator adjusts based on down and distance — but they provide a structured opening to the game that reduces the burden of in-game decision-making.

## Communication

### Staff Coordination

Game planning requires constant communication among the coaching staff. The head coach sets the strategic vision, but the coordinators and position coaches provide the detailed knowledge of their specific areas. Regular staff meetings throughout the week ensure that everyone is aligned and that the game plan is cohesive. The offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator must also be aware of each other's plans, as special situations (such as the two-minute drill or sudden change) require coordination between both units.

### Player Buy-In

The best game plan is worthless if the players do not understand or believe in it. Coaches must communicate the game plan in a way that is clear, concise, and motivating. Players need to understand not just what they are doing but why — how each concept is designed to exploit a specific weakness in the opponent. This understanding gives players confidence and allows them to make in-game adjustments based on what they see.

## Level Differences

### High School

High school game planning is typically less detailed due to smaller coaching staffs and less available film. Many high school coaches focus on perfecting their own scheme rather than making extensive opponent-specific adjustments.

### College (NCAA)

College game planning is highly detailed, with large staffs of analysts breaking down film and charting tendencies using technology platforms. Recruiting-related travel can limit the time coaches spend on game planning during certain periods.

### NFL

NFL game planning is the most comprehensive. Professional staffs include quality control coaches, analysts, and support personnel dedicated to film breakdown and data analysis. The game plan is the product of hundreds of hours of collective work and is arguably the most important factor in weekly preparation.

Game planning is where football is won before the game is played, turning preparation into a competitive advantage.
