## Overview

Tendency analysis is the systematic study of an opponent's play-calling patterns, formation usage, personnel deployment, and situational behavior. By charting and analyzing an opponent's tendencies from film, coaching staffs gain predictive insights that inform defensive alignments, blitz packages, coverage calls, and offensive play selection. The goal is to increase the probability of anticipating what the opponent will do on any given play, giving the defending team a fraction-of-a-second advantage that can be the difference between a stop and a big play. Tendency analysis has been a part of football preparation for decades, but modern data tools and analytics have elevated it to a precise science.

## What Gets Charted

### Formation and Personnel

Every snap is cataloged by formation and personnel grouping. Analysts record the number of backs, tight ends, and receivers, as well as the specific alignment — shotgun or under center, one-back or two-back, trips or twins. Patterns emerge quickly: an opponent may favor 11 personnel (1 back, 1 tight end, 3 receivers) on 65 percent of plays but shift to 12 personnel (1 back, 2 tight ends) in the red zone. Understanding these patterns helps the defensive coordinator decide which personnel grouping to deploy and how to align before the snap.

### Down and Distance

Play-calling tendencies are heavily influenced by down and distance. Analysts chart the run-pass ratio for every down-and-distance category: first-and-10, second-and-short, second-and-long, third-and-short, third-and-medium, third-and-long, and so forth. An opponent that passes 80 percent of the time on third-and-7-or-more gives the defense a strong pre-snap indicator. Similarly, an offense that runs the ball 75 percent of the time on first-and-10 allows the defense to shade its alignment toward the run.

### Play Direction

The direction of runs and the side of the field targeted by passes are charted to identify tendencies. Some offenses favor running to the strong side (toward the tight end) or the boundary (the short side of the field). Some quarterbacks throw more accurately to one side of the field than the other. These directional tendencies help defensive coordinators position their best players on the side of the field most likely to be attacked.

### Motion and Shift

Pre-snap motion and formation shifts are closely tracked because they often correlate with specific play types. An offense that uses jet motion may run a sweep in the direction of the motion 60 percent of the time, or the motion may be a decoy 40 percent of the time. Understanding the correlation between motion and play type allows defenders to react more confidently to pre-snap movement.

### Cadence and Tempo

The snap count and tempo are analyzed for patterns. Some quarterbacks use a hard count (a loud vocal signal designed to draw the defense ofside) in predictable situations, such as fourth-and-short or at the goal line. Some offenses snap the ball on a consistent count, which allows the defensive line to time their rush. Analysts also note when the offense speeds up or slows down its tempo and whether these tempo changes correlate with specific play types.

## Analysis Methods

### Percentage-Based Tendency Charts

The most basic form of tendency analysis involves calculating the percentage of runs versus passes from each formation, personnel grouping, and down-and-distance situation. These percentages are presented in a tendency chart that the coaching staff and players can reference during preparation and, in some cases, during the game itself.

### Conditional Probabilities

More advanced analysis uses conditional probabilities to layer multiple variables. For example: "When the opponent is in 11 personnel, on first-and-10, from the left hash, between the 20-yard lines, and the quarterback is under center, they run the ball 82 percent of the time, and 60 percent of those runs go to the left." This level of granularity provides highly specific predictive insights but requires a large enough sample size to be statistically meaningful.

### Frequency-of-Play Analysis

Beyond run-pass tendencies, analysts identify the specific plays an opponent runs most frequently in each situation. Knowing that an opponent runs inside zone on 40 percent of its first-down run plays and uses a four-verticals concept on 30 percent of its third-and-long pass plays allows the defense to prepare its best answers for the most probable play calls.

## Applying Tendencies in the Game

### Pre-Snap Reads

Tendency analysis informs pre-snap alignment and assignment. If the data indicates the opponent is likely to run, the defense can align in a run-heavy front. If the data suggests a pass, the defense can deploy an extra defensive back or call a blitz. The signal-caller on defense — typically the middle linebacker or a safety — uses tendency information to make real-time adjustments before the snap.

### Play-Call Preparation

Offensive and defensive coordinators build their game plan around the opponent's tendencies. The defensive coordinator selects coverages and fronts specifically designed to counter the opponent's most frequent and effective plays. The offensive coordinator designs play calls to exploit the opponent's defensive tendencies, such as running against a blitz-heavy defense or throwing to the flat against a defense that overplays the deep ball.

### Cautions

Tendency analysis has limitations. Opponents change their tendencies over the course of a season, install new concepts for specific games, and intentionally break from their tendencies in critical moments. Over-reliance on tendencies can lead to defenders hesitating when the opponent does something unexpected. The best defensive players use tendency information as a guide, not a guarantee.

## Level Differences

### High School

Tendency analysis at the high school level is often limited by the availability of film and the size of the coaching staff. Coaches who take the time to chart tendencies gain a significant advantage over opponents who do not.

### College (NCAA)

College programs employ analyst staffs that produce detailed tendency reports using specialized software. Tendency analysis is a core part of weekly game preparation, and players are expected to study and internalize the data.

### NFL

NFL tendency analysis is the most sophisticated in football. Teams use advanced data platforms, video tagging systems, and statistical models to identify tendencies at a granular level. Some teams employ data scientists who apply machine learning techniques to predict play calls based on situational variables.

Tendency analysis is the bridge between film study and game-day execution, turning raw information into actionable intelligence.
