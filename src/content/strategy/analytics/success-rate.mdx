## Overview

Success rate is a foundational football analytics metric that measures the percentage of plays on which the offense achieves a positive or expected outcome relative to the down and distance. Unlike raw yardage or first-down totals, success rate evaluates each play against a context-specific standard — what counts as a "successful" play on first-and-10 is different from what counts on third-and-1. By establishing clear thresholds for success on each down, the metric provides an efficient, binary measure of offensive and defensive consistency. Success rate has become one of the most widely referenced advanced statistics in football analysis, valued for its simplicity and its ability to capture the steady, down-to-down execution that drives sustained offensive production.

## Defining a Successful Play

### The Standard Thresholds

The most commonly used definition of a successful play is based on the following thresholds:

- **First down**: A play is successful if it gains at least 50 percent of the needed yardage. On first-and-10, a gain of 5 or more yards is a success.
- **Second down**: A play is successful if it gains at least 70 percent of the remaining yardage needed for a first down. On second-and-5, a gain of 3.5 or more yards is a success.
- **Third and fourth down**: A play is successful if it gains a first down or touchdown.

These thresholds reflect the idea that a successful drive requires steady progress on early downs to create manageable third-down situations. A team that gains 5 yards on first down, 4 yards on second down, and is left with third-and-1 has put itself in a strong position through two successful plays.

### Alternative Definitions

Some analysts use EPA-based success definitions, where any play with positive EPA (Expected Points Added) is considered successful. This approach accounts for the full context of each play, including field position and game situation, but is more complex to calculate. The traditional yardage-based thresholds remain the most widely used due to their simplicity and intuitive interpretation.

## Applications

### Offensive Consistency

Success rate is the best single measure of offensive consistency. A team with a high success rate is systematically moving the chains and creating favorable down-and-distance situations on nearly every play. High-success-rate offenses tend to sustain long drives, control time of possession, and avoid the negative plays that stall drives. In contrast, a team with a low success rate may produce occasional big plays but frequently finds itself behind schedule on drives, leading to punts and turnovers.

### Run vs. Pass Efficiency

Success rate is frequently broken down by play type to compare the efficiency of the run game versus the pass game. In the NFL, pass plays generally have a higher success rate than run plays — typically around 48 to 52 percent for passing versus 42 to 46 percent for rushing. This disparity has been a key data point in the broader analytics argument that teams should pass more often, though the relationship between run and pass success is more nuanced than a simple comparison suggests.

### Evaluating Defenses

Defensive success rate measures the percentage of plays on which the defense prevents the offense from achieving a successful outcome. A defense with a low opponent success rate is consistently putting the offense behind schedule, creating unfavorable down-and-distance situations. Defensive success rate is particularly useful for evaluating defenses that may not generate many turnovers or sacks but are effective at limiting steady offensive progress.

### Down-Specific Analysis

Breaking success rate down by individual downs reveals important tendencies. A team with a high first-down success rate is efficient at establishing early-down gains, which sets up the rest of the drive. A team with a low second-down success rate may be struggling to recover from poor first-down plays. Third-down success rate, while important, is partially a function of first and second down performance — teams that succeed on early downs face easier third-down conversions.

## Success Rate vs. Other Metrics

### Success Rate vs. EPA

Success rate and EPA are complementary metrics that measure different aspects of performance. Success rate treats every play as a binary outcome — success or failure — and weights each play equally. EPA measures the magnitude of each play's impact, with big plays receiving proportionally larger values. A team that produces a high success rate but few explosive plays will have a moderate EPA. A team that produces explosive plays but is inconsistent on a per-play basis may have a high total EPA but a lower success rate. The most effective offenses rank highly in both metrics.

### Success Rate vs. Yards Per Play

Yards per play is heavily influenced by big plays and does not account for down-and-distance context. A team that averages 6 yards per play but gains those yards in boom-or-bust fashion — alternating 15-yard gains with 2-yard losses — may have a lower success rate than a team that averages 5 yards per play through consistent, moderate gains. Success rate more accurately reflects the sustainability and reliability of an offense.

### Success Rate vs. Conversion Rate

Third-down conversion rate is a commonly cited statistic that measures only one aspect of offensive efficiency. Success rate is broader, encompassing all downs and providing a more complete picture of offensive execution. A team with a mediocre third-down conversion rate but a high early-down success rate may simply be converting first downs before reaching third down, which is actually a sign of offensive efficiency.

## Strategic Implications

### Early-Down Aggressiveness

Analytics research has shown that early-down play-calling significantly impacts success rate. Teams that are aggressive on first and second down — using play-action, taking calculated downfield shots, and mixing run and pass effectively — tend to have higher success rates than teams that adopt a conservative, run-heavy approach on early downs. Successful early-down play-calling creates manageable third downs, which are easier to convert.

### Defensive Game Planning

Defensive coordinators use opponent success rate data to identify which offensive concepts are most effective and game-plan accordingly. If an opponent has a high run success rate but a low pass success rate, the defense may focus on stopping the run and forcing the opponent into passing situations. Conversely, if the opponent passes effectively, the defense may prioritize coverage and pass rush.

## Level Differences

### High School

Success rate is not commonly tracked at the high school level, but coaches who chart their own games can calculate it manually and use it to evaluate offensive and defensive performance.

### College (NCAA)

College football success rate data is widely available through public analytics platforms and is used by media, fans, and coaching staffs to evaluate team performance.

### NFL

NFL success rate is one of the most commonly referenced advanced metrics in professional football analysis. It is used by teams, media, and betting markets to assess team quality and predict outcomes.

Success rate provides a clear, context-aware measure of offensive and defensive consistency, making it one of the most valuable tools in the football analyst's toolkit.
