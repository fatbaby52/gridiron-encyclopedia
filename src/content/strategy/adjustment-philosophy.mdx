## Overview

In-game adjustments are the modifications a coaching staff makes to its game plan during the course of a game in response to what the opponent is doing. No game plan survives first contact without the need for adaptation. The opponent may present a defensive front the offense did not expect, deploy an unfamiliar coverage, or attack a vulnerability the coaching staff did not anticipate. The ability to recognize these challenges and make effective adjustments in real time separates great coaching staffs from good ones. In-game adjustments are the bridge between preparation and execution, and they demand sharp observation, clear communication, and decisive action under pressure.

## The Observation Phase

### Press Box Communication

At most levels of football, assistant coaches are stationed in the press box with a bird's-eye view of the field. These coaches communicate with the coordinators on the sideline via headset, providing observations about the opponent's alignment, coverage, and tendencies. The press box coaches can see things that are invisible from field level — secondary rotations, defensive line stunts, and offensive formation patterns. This information flows continuously throughout the game and forms the basis for adjustment decisions.

### Sideline Communication

On the sideline, position coaches talk with their players between series to gather intel. A wide receiver reports that the cornerback is playing outside leverage on every snap. A defensive end notes that the offensive tackle is setting wide, leaving the inside gap vulnerable. An offensive lineman observes that the nose tackle is slanting one direction on every play. These player observations are relayed to the coordinators and inform real-time adjustments.

### Tablet and Video Review

In the NFL, teams have access to sideline tablets that display still images of recent plays. Coaches and players use these images to review formations, alignments, and coverages. While full video replay on the sideline is not permitted during games, the still images provide valuable information that helps coaches identify patterns and make adjustments. College teams have similar access to still images or printouts from the press box.

## Types of Adjustments

### Schematic Adjustments

Schematic adjustments involve changing the plays, formations, or concepts being used. An offensive coordinator who sees that the defense is playing single-high safety coverage may add more vertical routes to attack the middle of the field. A defensive coordinator who notices the offense is running primarily from shotgun may switch to a front designed to better defend the spread. These adjustments draw from the playbook's depth — concepts that were not in the original game plan but are part of the team's installation and can be activated when needed.

### Personnel Adjustments

Sometimes the adjustment is not about scheme but about people. A cornerback who is struggling against a particular receiver may be replaced or given safety help over the top. A running back who is having trouble with pass protection may be substituted for a more capable blocker. An offensive lineman who is being beaten by a specific pass-rush move may be given a chip from a tight end or running back. Personnel adjustments acknowledge that individual matchups can override schematic advantages.

### Alignment and Technique Adjustments

The smallest and most frequent adjustments involve alignment and technique. A defensive end who is lining up too wide may be told to tighten their alignment. A linebacker who is dropping too deep in zone coverage may be instructed to sit at a shallower depth. A receiver who is running routes too flat may be coached to add more depth to create separation. These micro-adjustments happen constantly between series and can have a cumulative effect over the course of the game.

## Halftime Adjustments

### The Most Important 15 Minutes

Halftime provides the most structured opportunity for adjustments. The coaching staff convenes in the locker room, reviews observations from the first half, and identifies 2 to 3 key adjustments for each phase of the game. Time is limited — typically 12 to 15 minutes of actual discussion time — so the adjustments must be clear and concise. Overloading players with too many changes at halftime can create confusion rather than clarity.

### Second-Half Script

Some coordinators prepare a second-half script or a list of "answers" — plays specifically designed to counter what the opponent has shown in the first half. If the defense has been playing predominantly Cover 3, the offensive coordinator may script concepts that attack the seams and flats of Cover 3 for the opening drive of the second half. If the offense has been running successfully to one side, the defensive coordinator may adjust the front and secondary alignment to take away that run.

## Common Adjustment Scenarios

### Unexpected Coverage

When the defense deploys a coverage the offense did not prepare for, the offensive coordinator must quickly identify concepts from the playbook that attack that coverage and communicate them to the quarterback. Hot routes, audibles, and check-with-me plays give the quarterback the ability to adjust at the line of scrimmage without waiting for a sideline adjustment.

### Run Game Dominance

When one team is dominating the run game — either offensively or defensively — the other side must adjust. A defense being run on may add an extra defender to the box, shift its front, or change its gap assignment philosophy. An offense that cannot run may shift to a more pass-heavy approach or change its run scheme entirely.

### Blitz Pressure

When the defense is generating significant pressure through blitzes, the offense must adjust its protection scheme, add hot routes, and possibly adjust the formation to give the quarterback quicker throws and more immediate answers to pressure.

## Level Differences

### High School

In-game adjustments at the high school level are more limited due to smaller coaching staffs and fewer schematic options. The best high school coaches make simple, impactful adjustments — changing a blocking scheme, moving a defensive player to a different gap, or adding a quick screen to counter a blitz.

### College (NCAA)

College programs make extensive in-game adjustments, supported by large staffs of analysts who process data in real time. Many college teams have analysts dedicated to charting the opponent's tendencies during the game and providing the coaching staff with updated tendency reports at halftime.

### NFL

NFL in-game adjustments are the most sophisticated. The combination of press box coaches, sideline tablets, player feedback, and real-time data analysis allows NFL coaching staffs to identify and implement adjustments with remarkable precision. The best NFL teams are consistently better in the second half than the first, a testament to their adjustment capabilities.

In-game adjustments are the art of coaching in motion, turning observations into actions that shift the trajectory of a game.
