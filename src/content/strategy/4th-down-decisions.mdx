## Overview

Fourth down is the most consequential decision point in football. When a team faces fourth down, the coaching staff must choose between punting to flip field position, attempting a field goal to put points on the board, or going for it to sustain the drive. For decades, convention dictated conservative decisions — punt in your own territory, kick field goals inside the 35, and go for it only in short-yardage desperation. The rise of football analytics has fundamentally challenged this orthodoxy, revealing that teams have been far too conservative on fourth down and leaving significant value on the table. The fourth-down decision has become a flashpoint in the broader debate between traditional coaching philosophy and data-driven decision-making.

## Traditional Approach

### Punt

The default fourth-down choice for most of football history has been to punt. The reasoning is straightforward: giving the ball to the opponent in poor field position is safer than risking a turnover on downs, which hands the opponent the ball at the spot of failure. The punt was considered the "smart" play in almost every situation outside of obvious short-yardage or late-game scenarios.

### Field Goal

When a team reached fourth down within field goal range — historically inside the opponent's 35-yard line — the conventional wisdom was to take the three points. "Never leave points on the board" was a coaching mantra. Kicking a field goal was seen as a guaranteed reward (though field goals are far from automatic), while going for the first down carried the risk of coming away with nothing.

### Traditional Decision Thresholds

Classic coaching wisdom created rough guidelines:
- **4th and 1 or less**: Consider going for it in opponent's territory.
- **4th and 2-3**: Punt unless desperate or in obvious field goal range.
- **4th and 4+**: Almost always punt or kick.
- **Inside the opponent's 5-yard line**: Go for the touchdown rather than kick a chip-shot field goal in some situations.

These thresholds were based on intuition, experience, and a strong aversion to risk that permeated football culture for generations.

## Analytics Revolution

### Expected Points

The concept of expected points (EP) assigns a point value to every game situation based on down, distance, field position, and score. Using vast historical databases, analysts calculated the average number of points a team could expect to score from any situation. This framework allowed for objective comparison of fourth-down options.

For example, if a team faces 4th and 2 at the opponent's 40-yard line, the expected points model compares three scenarios:
- **Going for it**: The expected points of converting (and gaining a first down) multiplied by the probability of conversion, minus the expected points surrendered if the attempt fails.
- **Punting**: The expected points surrendered by the opponent's next drive starting position.
- **Field Goal Attempt**: The probability of making the field goal multiplied by three points, minus the expected points surrendered from the resulting kickoff or a miss.

### Win Probability

Win probability (WP) models take the analysis further by considering the game situation — score, time remaining, timeouts, and possession. While expected points provides a neutral evaluation, win probability accounts for game context. A decision that maximizes expected points in a tie game might be different from the optimal choice when trailing by 10 in the fourth quarter.

The New York Times' "4th Down Bot," created by Brian Burke, became one of the most visible public examples of this analysis. It provided real-time fourth-down recommendations during NFL games, frequently disagreeing with coaches' actual decisions and demonstrating how often teams punted or kicked when going for it was the mathematically superior choice.

## When to Go For It

Analytics research has consistently shown that teams should go for it on fourth down far more often than they traditionally have. The general findings include:

- **4th and 1-2**: Go for it in almost all field positions. The conversion rate on 4th and 1 is approximately 70% in the NFL, and on 4th and 2 approximately 55-60%. These rates make going for it the optimal choice in the vast majority of situations.
- **4th and 3-4**: Go for it from roughly the opponent's 40-yard line to the opponent's 30-yard line — the area sometimes called "no man's land" where a punt cannot pin the opponent deep and a field goal is a long attempt.
- **4th and short near midfield**: This is where the gap between traditional and analytical decision-making is largest. Punting from midfield typically nets only 35-40 yards of field position, while converting a short fourth down keeps the drive alive.
- **4th and goal inside the 3**: Go for the touchdown rather than settling for a field goal. The expected point value of a touchdown attempt exceeds that of a near-certain field goal because the conversion rate is high enough.

## When to Punt or Kick

Analytics does not recommend going for it on every fourth down. There are clear situations where punting or kicking is optimal:

- **Deep in your own territory (inside the 30)**: The cost of failure is too high. Giving the opponent the ball in scoring position has an enormous negative expected point value.
- **4th and long (5+ yards)**: Conversion rates drop below 40%, making the risk-reward calculation less favorable except in late-game desperation.
- **Close, high-probability field goals**: Inside the opponent's 20-yard line, where NFL kickers convert above 85%, the field goal is often the correct call unless the game situation demands a touchdown.
- **When leading comfortably**: If a team has a multi-score lead, the risk of a failed fourth-down attempt (which could give the opponent momentum and field position) outweighs the potential reward.

## Coaching Philosophy Shift

The analytics revolution has gradually changed coaching behavior, though significant resistance remains.

### Early Adopters

Kevin Kelley, a high school coach in Arkansas, gained national attention for never punting — and his teams consistently outperformed expectations. At the NFL level, coaches like Doug Pederson (Philadelphia Eagles) and Sean McDermott (Buffalo Bills) embraced more aggressive fourth-down strategies.

### The New Generation

A wave of younger coaches hired in the late 2010s and 2020s — including Brandon Staley, Matt LaFleur, and Nick Sirianni — entered the NFL with a strong analytical foundation. These coaches were more comfortable with aggressive fourth-down decisions and viewed analytics as a core component of game planning.

### Remaining Resistance

Despite the data, many coaches remain conservative on fourth down. The asymmetry of blame plays a significant role: a coach who goes for it and fails faces intense criticism, while a coach who punts and loses is rarely blamed for the individual punt decision. This incentive structure discourages risk-taking, even when the data supports it. Job security concerns and media scrutiny continue to influence fourth-down decisions at every level.

## Famous Decisions

Several fourth-down decisions have become defining moments in football history:

- **Bill Belichick's 4th and 2 (2009)**: Trailing the Indianapolis Colts by 6 with just over two minutes remaining, Belichick elected to go for it on 4th and 2 from the Patriots' own 28-yard line. The attempt failed, and the Colts scored quickly to win. Analytics widely supported Belichick's decision, but it was met with intense public criticism.
- **Kevin Kelley's Never-Punt Philosophy**: Kelley's Pulaski Academy teams routinely went for it on fourth down regardless of field position, demonstrating that aggressive decision-making could work consistently at the high school level.
- **Brandon Staley's Aggressive Approach (2021)**: The Chargers' head coach became known for the most aggressive fourth-down approach in the NFL, going for it at historically high rates — sometimes to the point of controversy when attempts in his own territory failed.
- **Super Bowl XLIX Goal-Line Decision (2015)**: Pete Carroll's decision to pass on 2nd and goal from the 1-yard line (intercepted by Malcolm Butler) is often debated as a risk-management question, illustrating how even non-fourth-down decisions involve similar analytical frameworks.

## Level Differences

### High School

Fourth-down decision-making at the high school level is the most varied. Some programs, inspired by coaches like Kevin Kelley, adopt aggressive approaches. Most, however, remain conservative, partly because high school kicking games are less reliable (making field goals less of a factor) and partly because of tradition. The wide range of talent levels means that going for it on fourth down can be especially rewarding for dominant teams facing weaker opponents.

### College (NCAA)

College football has seen a significant shift toward more aggressive fourth-down play-calling, driven by analytics departments that now exist at most Power 5 programs. The college game's wider hash marks and prevalence of spread offenses make short-yardage conversions slightly easier. College coaches increasingly go for it on 4th and 1 and 4th and 2 in opponent territory.

### NFL

The NFL has seen the most dramatic shift in fourth-down philosophy. League-wide go-for-it rates have increased steadily, with the 2020s seeing record numbers of fourth-down attempts. Every NFL team now employs analytics staff who provide real-time fourth-down recommendations. However, the gap between what analytics recommends and what coaches actually do remains substantial, suggesting that the fourth-down revolution is still underway.

The fourth-down decision encapsulates the broader tension between tradition and innovation in football — and the data strongly suggests that the game's conventional wisdom has left enormous value on the field for decades.
